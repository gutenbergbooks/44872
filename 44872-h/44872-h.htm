<h1 title="">THE MAN WHO FELL
<br />THROUGH THE
<br />EARTH</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />Moving Shadow-Shapes</h2>
<p>One of the occasions when I experienced
&ldquo;that grand and glorious feeling&rdquo; was
when my law business had achieved proportions
that justified my removal from my old
office to new and more commodious quarters. I
selected a somewhat pretentious building on Madison
Avenue between Thirtieth and Fortieth Streets,
and it was a red-letter day for me when I moved
into my pleasant rooms on its top floor.</p>
<p>The Puritan Trust Company occupied all of the
ground floor and there were also some of the private
offices of that institution on the top floor, as
well as a few offices to be let.</p>
<p>My rooms were well located and delightfully
light, and I furnished them with care, selecting
chairs and desks of a dignified type, and rugs of
appropriately quiet coloring. I also selected my
stenographer with care, and Norah MacCormack
was a red-haired piece of perfection. If she had
a weakness, it was for reading detective stories, but
I condoned that, for in my hammocky moods I,
too, dipped into the tangled-web school of fiction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>And, without undue conceit, I felt that I could
give most specimens of the genus Sherlock cards
and spades and beat them at their own game of
deduction. I practiced it on Norah sometimes.
She would bring me a veil or glove of some friend
of hers, and I would try to deduce the friend&rsquo;s
traits of character. My successes and failures were
about fifty-fifty, but Norah thought I improved
with practice, and, anyway, it exercised my intelligence.</p>
<p>I had failed to pass examination for the army,
because of a defect, negligible, it seemed to me, in
my eyesight. I was deeply disappointed, but as the
law of compensation is usually in force, I unexpectedly
proved to be of some use to my Government
after all.</p>
<p class="tb">Across the hall from me was the private office
of Amos Gately, the President of the Puritan Trust
Company, and a man of city-wide reputation. I
didn&rsquo;t know the great financier personally, but
everyone knew of him, and his name was a
synonym for all that is sound, honorable, and
philanthropic in the money mart. He was of that
frequently seen type, with the silver gray hair that
so becomingly accompanies deep-set dark eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>And yet, I had never seen Mr. Gately himself.
My knowledge of him was gained from his frequent
portraiture in the papers or in an occasional
magazine. And I had gathered, in a vague way,
that he was a connoisseur of the fine arts, and that
his offices, as well as his home, were palatial in
their appointments.</p>
<p>I may as well admit, therefore, that going in
and out of my own rooms I often looked toward
his door, in hopes that I might get a glimpse, at
least, of the treasures within. But so far I had
not done so.</p>
<p>To be sure, I had only occupied my own suite
about a week and then again Mr. Gately was not
always in his private offices during business hours.
Doubtless, much of the time he was down in the
banking rooms.</p>
<p>There was a yellow-haired stenographer, who
wore her hair in ear-muffs, and who was, I should
say, addicted to the vanity-case. This young person,
Norah had informed me, was Jenny Boyd.</p>
<p>And that sums up the whole of my intimate
knowledge of Amos Gately&mdash;until the day of the
black snow squall!</p>
<p>I daresay my prehistoric ancestors were sun-worshipers.
At any rate, I am perfectly happy
when the sun shines, and utterly miserable on a
gloomy day. Of course, after sunset, I don&rsquo;t care,
but days when artificial light must be used, I get
fidgety and am positively unable to concentrate on
any important line of thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>And so, when Norah snapped on her green-shaded
desk light in mid-afternoon, I impulsively
jumped up to go home. I could stand electrically
lighted rooms better in my diggings than in the
work-compelling atmosphere of my office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish that bit of work,&rdquo; I told my competent
assistant, &ldquo;and then go home yourself. I&rsquo;m going
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only three o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and
Norah&rsquo;s gray eyes looked up from the clicking
keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, but a snow storm is brewing,&mdash;and
Lord knows there&rsquo;s snow enough in town now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so! I&rsquo;m thinking they won&rsquo;t get the
black mountains out of the side streets before
Fourth of July,&mdash;and the poor White Wings working
themselves to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Statistics haven&rsquo;t yet proved that cause of
death prevalent among snow-shovelers,&rdquo; I returned,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s more chance for it
coming to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hate snow. For the ocular defect that kept me
out of the army is corrected by not altogether unbecoming
glasses, but when these are moistened or
misted by falling snow, I am greatly incommoded.
So I determined to reach home, if possible, before
the squall which was so indubitably imminent.</p>
<p>I snugged into my overcoat, and jammed my hat
well down on my head, for the wind was already
blowing a gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get away soon, Norah,&rdquo; I said, as I opened
the door into the hall, &ldquo;and if it proves a blizzard
you needn&rsquo;t show up tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be here, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she returned, in
her cheery way, and resumed her clicking.</p>
<p class="tb">The offices of Mr. Gately, opposite mine, had
three doors to the hall, meaning, I assumed, three
rooms in his suite.</p>
<p>My own door was exactly opposite the middle
one of the three. On that was the number two.
To its left was number one, and to its right, number
three.</p>
<p>Each of these three doors had an upper panel
of thick, clouded glass, and, as the hall was not
yet lighted and Mr. Gately&rsquo;s rooms were, I could
see quite plainly the shadows of two heads on the
middle door,&mdash;the door numbered two.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am unduly curious, perhaps it was
merely a natural interest, but I stood still a moment,
outside my own door, and watched the two
shadowed heads.</p>
<p>The rippled clouding of the glass made their outlines
somewhat vague, but I could distinguish the
fine, thick mane of Amos Gately, as I had so often
seen it pictured. The other was merely a human
shadow with no striking characteristics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>It was evident their interview was not amicable.
I heard a loud, explosive &ldquo;No!&rdquo; from one or
other of them, and then both figures rose and
there was a hand-to-hand struggle. Their voices
indicated a desperate quarrel, though no words
were distinguishable.</p>
<p>And then, as I looked, the shadows blurred into
one another,&mdash;swayed,&mdash;separated, and then a pistol
shot rang out, followed immediately by a
woman&rsquo;s shrill scream.</p>
<p>Impulsively I sprang across the hall, and turned
the knob of door number two,&mdash;the one opposite
my own door, and the one through which I had
seen the shadowed actions.</p>
<p>But the door would not open.</p>
<p>I hesitated only an instant and then hurried to
the door next on the right, number three.</p>
<p>This, too, was fastened on the inside, so I ran
back to the only other door, number one,&mdash;to the
left of the middle door.</p>
<p>This door opened at my touch, and I found
myself in the first of Amos Gately&rsquo;s magnificent
rooms.</p>
<p>Beyond one quick, admiring glance, I paid no
attention to the beautiful appointments, and I
opened the communicating door into the next or
middle room.</p>
<p>This, like the first, contained no human being,
but it was filled with the smoke and the odor of
a recently fired pistol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>I looked around, aghast. This was the room
where the altercation had taken place, where two
men had grappled, where a pistol had been fired,
and moreover, where a woman had screamed.
Where were these people?</p>
<p>In the next room, of course, I reasoned.</p>
<p>With eager curiosity, I went on into the third
room. It was empty.</p>
<p>And that was all the rooms of the suite.</p>
<p>Where were the people I had seen and heard?
That is, I had seen their shadows on the glass door,
and human shadows cannot appear without people
to cast them. Where were the men who had
fought? Where was the woman who had screamed?
And who were they?</p>
<p class="tb">Dazed, I went back through the rooms. Their
several uses were clear enough. Number one was
the entrance office. There was an attendant&rsquo;s desk,
a typewriter, reception chairs, and all the effects of
the first stage of an interview with the great man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The second office, beyond a doubt, was Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s sanctum. A stunning mahogany table-desk
was in the middle of the floor, and a large,
unusually fine swivel-chair stood behind it. On the
desk, things were somewhat disordered. The telephone
was upset, the papers pushed into an untidy
heap, a pen-tray overturned, and a chair opposite
the big desk chair lay over on its side, as if Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s visitor had risen hurriedly. The last
room, number three, was, clearly, the very holy of
holies. Surely, only the most important or most
beloved guests were received in here. It was furnished
as richly as a royal salon, yet all in most
perfect taste and quiet harmony. The general coloring
of draperies and upholstery was soft blue, and
splendid pictures hung on the wall. Also, there
was a huge war map of Europe, and indicative pins
stuck in it proved Mr. Gately&rsquo;s intense interest in
the progress of events over there.</p>
<p>But though tempted to feast my eyes on the art
treasures all about, I eagerly pursued my quest for
the vanished human beings I sought.</p>
<p>There was no one in any of these three rooms,
and I could see no exit, save into the hall from
which I had entered. I looked into three or four
cupboards, but they were full of books and papers,
and no sign of a hidden human being, alive or
dead, could I find.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strangeness of it all blunted my
efficiency. I had always flattered myself that I
was at my best in an emergency, but all previous
emergencies in which I had found myself were
trivial and unimportant compared with this.</p>
<p>I felt as if I had been at a moving picture show.
I had seen, as on the screen, a man shot, perhaps
killed, and now all the actors had vanished as completely
as they do when the movie is over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Then, for I am not entirely devoid of conscience,
it occurred to me that I had a duty,&mdash;that it was
incumbent upon me to report to somebody. I
thought of the police, but was it right to call them
when I had so vague a report to make? What
could I tell them? That I had seen shadows fighting?
Heard a woman scream? Smelled smoke?
Heard the report of a pistol? A whimsical thought
came that the report of the pistol was the only
definite report I could swear to!</p>
<p>Yet the whole scene was definite enough to me.</p>
<p>I had seen two men fighting,&mdash;shadows, to be
sure, but shadows of real men. I had heard their
voices raised in dissension of some sort, I had seen
a scuffle and had heard a shot, of which I had
afterward smelled the smoke, and,&mdash;most incriminating
of all,&mdash;I had heard a woman&rsquo;s scream. A
scream, too, of terror, as for her life!</p>
<p>And then, I had immediately entered these
rooms, and I had found them empty of all human
presence, but with the smoke still hanging low, to
prove my observations had been real, and no figment
of my imagination.</p>
<p>I believed I had latent detective ability. Well,
surely here was a chance to exercise it!</p>
<p>What more bewildering mystery could be desired
than to witness a shooting, and, breaking in
upon the scene, to find no victim, no criminal, and
no weapon!</p>
<p>I hunted for the pistol, but found no more trace
of that than of the hand that had fired it.</p>
<p>My brain felt queer; I said to myself, over and
over, &ldquo;a fight, a shot, a scream! No victim, no
criminal, no weapon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>I looked out in the hall again. I had already
looked out two or three times, but I had seen no
one. However, I didn&rsquo;t suppose the villain and his
victim had gone down by the elevator or by the
stairway.</p>
<p>But where were they? And where was the
woman who had screamed?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was she who had been shot. Why
did I assume that Mr. Gately was the victim?
Could not he have been the criminal?</p>
<p>The thought of Amos Gately in the r&ocirc;le of murderer
was a little too absurd! Still, the whole
situation was absurd.</p>
<p>For me, Tom Brice, to be involved in this
baffling mystery was the height of all that was
incredible!</p>
<p>And yet, was I involved? I had only to walk
out and go home to be out of it all. No one had
seen me and no one could know I had been there.</p>
<p>And then something sinister overcame me. A
kind of cold dread of the whole affair; an uncanny
feeling that I was drawn into a fearful web of
circumstances from which I could not honorably
escape, if, indeed, I could escape at all. The three
Gately rooms, though lighted, felt dark and eerie.
I glanced out of a window. The sky was almost
black and scattering snowflakes were falling. I
realized, too, that though the place was lighted,
the fixtures were those great alabaster bowls, and,
as they hung from the ceiling, they seemed to give
out a ghostly radiance that emphasized the strange
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>For, in my increasingly nervous state, the silence
was intensified and it seemed the silence of death,&mdash;not
the mere quiet of an empty room.</p>
<p>I pulled myself together, for I had not lost all
sense of my duty. I <i>must</i> do something, I told
myself, sternly,&mdash;but what?</p>
<p>My hand crept toward the telephone that lay,
turned over on its side, on Mr. Gately&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>But I drew back quickly, not so much because of
a disinclination to touch the thing that had perhaps
figured in a tragedy but because of a dim
instinct of leaving everything untouched as a possible
clew.</p>
<p>Clew! The very word helped restore my
equilibrium. There had been a crime of some
sort,&mdash;at least, there had been a shooting, and I
had been an eye-witness, even if my eyes had seen
only shadows.</p>
<p>My r&ocirc;le, then, was an important one. My duty
was to tell what I had seen and render any assistance
I could. But I wouldn&rsquo;t use that telephone.
It must be out of order, anyway, or the operator
downstairs would be looking after it. I would go
back to my own office and call up somebody. As
I crossed the hall, I was still debating whether that
somebody would better be the police or the bank
people downstairs. The latter, I decided, for it was
their place to look after their president, not mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>I found Norah putting on her hat. The sight
of her shrewd gray eyes and intelligent face caused
an outburst of confidence, and I told her the whole
story as fast as I could rattle it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes wide
with excitement, &ldquo;let me go over there! May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Norah: I think I ought to speak
to the bank people. I think I&rsquo;ll telephone down
and ask if Mr. Gately is down there. You know
it may not have been Mr. Gately at all, whose
shadow I saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, yes, it was! You couldn&rsquo;t mistake his
head, and, too, who else would be in there?
Please, Mr. Brice, wait just a minute before you
telephone,&mdash;let me take one look round,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
want to make a&mdash;to look foolish, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had so nearly warned me against making a
fool of myself, that I took the hint, and I followed
her across the hall.</p>
<p>She went in quickly at the door of room number
one. One glance around it and she said, &ldquo;This is
the first office, you see: callers come here, the secretary
or stenographer takes their names and all that,
and shows them into Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Norah spoke she went on to the second
room. Oblivious to its grandeur and luxury, she
gave swift, darting glances here and there and
said positively: &ldquo;Of course, it was Mr. Gately who
was shot, and by a woman too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman who screamed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No: more likely not. I expect the woman who
screamed was his stenographer. I know her,&mdash;at
least, I&rsquo;ve seen her. A little doll-faced jig, who
belongs about third from the end, in the chorus!
Be sure she&rsquo;d scream at the pistol shot, but the
lady who fired the shot wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw the scrimmage and it was a man
who shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure? That thick, clouded glass blurs
a shadow beyond recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think it was a woman, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; and Norah pointed to a hatpin that lay
on the big desk.</p>
<p>It was a fine-looking pin, with a big head, but
when I was about to pick it up Norah dissuaded
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it,&rdquo; she warned; &ldquo;you know, Mr.
Brice, we&rsquo;ve really no right here and we simply
must not touch anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Norah,&rdquo; I began, my common sense and
good judgment having returned to me with the
advent of human companionship, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
do anything wrong. If we&rsquo;ve no right here, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a minute, but let me think what you
ought to do. And, oh, do let me take a minute
to look round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, girl; this is no time to satisfy your
curiosity or, to enjoy a sight of these&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that! But I want to see if
there isn&rsquo;t some clew or some bit of evidence to
the whole thing. It is too weird! too impossible
that three people should have disappeared into
nothingness! Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah looked in the same closets I had explored;
she drew aside window draperies and porti&egrave;res, she
hastily glanced under desks and tables, not so much,
I felt sure, in expectation of finding anyone, as
with a general idea of searching the place thoroughly.</p>
<p>She scrutinized the desk fittings of the stenographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything of the best,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;but
very little real work done up here. I fancy these
offices of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s are more for private conferences
and personal appointments than any real
business matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would account for the lady&rsquo;s hatpin,&rdquo;
I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but how did they get out? You looked
out in the hall, at once, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I came quickly through these three
rooms, and then looked out into the hall at once,
and there was no elevator in sight nor could I see
anyone on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not much to be seen here. I
suppose you&rsquo;d better call up the bank people.
Though if they thought there was anything queer
they&rsquo;d be up here by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>I left Norah in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s rooms while I went
back to my own office and called up the Puritan
Trust Company.</p>
<p>A polite voice assured me that they knew nothing
of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s whereabouts at that moment,
but if I would leave a message he would ultimately
receive it.</p>
<p>So, then, I told them, in part, what had happened,
or, rather, what I believed had happened, and still
a little unconcerned, the polite man agreed to send
somebody up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffy people!&rdquo; I said to Norah, as I returned
to the room she was in. &ldquo;They seemed to think
me officious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared they would, Mr. Brice, but you had to
do it. There&rsquo;s no doubt Mr. Gately left this room
in mad haste. See, here&rsquo;s his personal checkbook
on his desk, and he drew a check today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing remarkable in his drawing a check,&rdquo;
I observed, &ldquo;but decidedly peculiar to leave his
checkbook around so carelessly. As you say,
Norah, he left in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the mystery; and I, for one, give it up.
I&rsquo;m quite willing to wait until some greater brain
than mine works out the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s incomprehensible,&rdquo; Norah went on;
&ldquo;where&rsquo;s Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter,&rdquo; I countered, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Mr.
Gately? Where&rsquo;s his angry visitor, male or female?
and, finally, where&rsquo;s the pistol that made
the sound and smoke of which I had positive
evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may find that,&rdquo; suggested Norah, hopefully.</p>
<p>But careful search failed to discover any firearms,
as it had failed to reveal the actors of the
drama.</p>
<p>Nor did the representative from the bank come
up at once. This seemed queer, I thought, and
with a sudden impulse to find out something, I
declared I was going down to the bank myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Norah, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here, for I must
know what they find out when they do come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went out into the hall and pushed the &ldquo;Down&rdquo;
button of the elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Norah warned me, as the car was
heard ascending, &ldquo;say very little, Mr. Brice,
except to the proper authorities. This may be a
terrible thing, and you mustn&rsquo;t get mixed up in it
until you know more about it. You were not only
the first to discover the disappearance,&mdash;but you
and I are apparently the only ones in this corridor
who know of it yet, we may be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspected of the abduction of Amos Gately!
Hardly! Don&rsquo;t let your detective instinct run
away with you Norah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the elevator door slid open and I got
into the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />Jenny&rsquo;s Version</h2>
<p>The elevators in the building were run by
girls, and the one I entered was in charge
of Minny Boyd, a sister of Jenny, who was
in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped into the car I saw that
Minny was in a state of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and the girl burst into tears,
&ldquo;Jenny said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I urged, as she hesitated, &ldquo;what did
Jenny say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; I asked, trying to be casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, about Mr. Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone! Disappeared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amos Gately? The president of the Puritan
Trust Company! Minny, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Brice, only a little while ago, I took
Jenny down. She was crying like everything and
she said that Mr. Gately had been shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what she said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but Jenny was nearly crazy! I
told her to go to the lunchroom,&mdash;that&rsquo;s where the
girls go when off duty,&mdash;and I said I&rsquo;d come to her
as soon as I could. I can&rsquo;t leave my car, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Minny,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;but what
did Jenny mean? Did she see Mr. Gately shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&mdash;but she heard a pistol
fired off, and she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ran into Mr. Gately&rsquo;s private office,&mdash;and,
he wasn&rsquo;t there! And then she&mdash;oh, I suppose she
hadn&rsquo;t any right to do it,&mdash;but she ran on to his
own personal room,&mdash;the one where she is never
allowed to go,&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t anybody there!
So Jenny was scared out of her senses, and she ran
out here,&mdash;to the hall, I mean,&mdash;and I took her
downstairs,&mdash;and oh, Mr. Brice, I&rsquo;ve got to stop
at this floor,&mdash;there&rsquo;s a call,&mdash;and please don&rsquo;t say
anything about it,&mdash;I mean don&rsquo;t tell I said anything&mdash;for
Jenny told me not to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw Minny was in great perturbation, and I
forebore to question her further, for just then we
stopped at the seventh floor and a man entered the
elevator.</p>
<p>I knew him,&mdash;that is, I knew he was George
Rodman,&mdash;but I wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently acquainted to
speak to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>So the three of us went on down in silence, past
the other floors, and reached the ground floor,
where Rodman and I got out.</p>
<p>Waiting to go up, I found Mr. Pitt, a discount
clerk of the Puritan Trust Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Brice?&rdquo; he said, in a superior
way.</p>
<p>I resented the superiority, but I admitted his soft
impeachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say there is something to be investigated
in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s offices?&rdquo; he went on, as if I
were a Food Administrator, or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I returned, a little curtly, &ldquo;I chanced
to see and hear and smell a pistol shot,&mdash;and further
looking into the matter failed to show anybody
killed or wounded or&mdash;in fact, failed to disclose
anybody whatever on the job, and I confess it all
looks to me mighty queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask why it appeals to you as
queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked Friend Pitt square in the eye, and I
said, &ldquo;It seems to me queer that a bank president
should drop out of existence and even out of his
business affiliations in one minute without any recognition
of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you overestimate an outside interest,&rdquo;
said Pitt. &ldquo;You must know it is really none of
the business of the Puritan Trust Company what
Mr. Gately does in his leisure hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Pitt,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;then let us
go and interview the young woman who is Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s stenographer and who is even now in
hysterics in the employees&rsquo; lunchroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt seemed duly impressed and together we
went to find Jenny.</p>
<p>The lunchroom for the employees of the building
was a pleasant place, on the ground floor, and
therein we found Jenny, the yellow-haired stenographer
of Amos Gately.</p>
<p>The girl was, without doubt, hysterical, and her
account of the shooting was disjointed and incoherent.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Pitt was of the supercilious type,
the kind who never believes anything, and his manner,
as he listened to Jenny&rsquo;s story, was incredulous
and almost scoffing.</p>
<p>So Jenny&rsquo;s story, though to me illuminating, was,
I felt sure, to Pitt, of little value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jenny exclaimed, &ldquo;I was in my room,
the first room, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to listen,&mdash;I never
do! and then, all of a sudden, I heard somebody
threatening Mr. Gately! That made me listen,&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t care if it was wrong&mdash;and then, I heard
somebody quarreling with Mr. Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they were quarreling?&rdquo;
interposed Pitt&rsquo;s cold voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help knowing, sir. I heard Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s usually pleasant voice raised as if in anger,
and I heard the visitor&rsquo;s voice, high and angry
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know the visitor&rsquo;s voice? you had
never heard it before?&rdquo; asked Pitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I&rsquo;ve no idea who he could have been!&rdquo;
and the foolish little Jenny bridled and looked like
an innocent <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>.</p>
<p>I broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you admit all visitors or callers to
Mr. Gately?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>Jenny looked at me. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I
received all who came to my door, but there were
others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they enter?&rdquo; asked Pitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they came in at the other doors. You see,
I only looked after my own room. Of course, if
Miss Raynor came,&mdash;or anybody that Mr. Gately
knew personally&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jenny paused discreetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Miss Raynor come this morning?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jenny replied, &ldquo;she did. That is, not
this morning, but early this afternoon. I know
Miss Raynor very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt seemed a little disturbed from his usual
calm, and with evident reluctance said to me, &ldquo;I
think, Mr. Brice, that this matter is more serious
than I thought. It seems to me that it would be
wise to refer the whole matter to Mr. Talcott, the
secretary of the Trust Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I was only too glad to refer the matter to
anybody who could be considered authoritative, and
I agreed at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; said Mr. Pitt, as he gave an anxious
glance at Jenny, &ldquo;I think it well to take this
young woman along, as she is the secretary of Mr.
Gately and may know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; cried Jenny, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything!
Please don&rsquo;t ask me questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s perturbation seemed to make Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s
intentions more definite, and he corralled the young
woman, as he also swept me along.</p>
<p>In a moment, we were all going into the offices
of the Puritan Trust Company.</p>
<p>And here, Mr. Pitt faded from view, and he left
us in the august presence of Mr. Talcott, the secretary
of the Company.</p>
<p>I found myself in the quiet, pleasant atmosphere
of the usual banker&rsquo;s office, and Mr. Talcott, a
kindly gentleman of middle-aged aristocracy, began
to question me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that
this story of yours about Mr. Gately is not only
important but mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Mr. Talcott,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;and
yet, the whole crux of the matter is whether Mr.
Gately is, at present, in some one of his offices, or,
perhaps at his home, or whether his whereabouts
are undetermined.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; the secretary went on,
&ldquo;it is none of our business where Mr. Gately is,
outside of his banking hours; and yet, in view of
Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s report of your account, it is incumbent
upon us, the officers of the Trust Company, to look
into the matter. Will you tell me, please, all you
know of the circumstances pertaining to Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s disappearance,&mdash;if he has disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has disappeared!&rdquo; I snapped back; &ldquo;and,
pray, sir, if he has not disappeared, where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Talcott, still unmoved, responded, &ldquo;That is
aside the question, for the moment. What do you
know of the matter, Mr. Brice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied by telling him all I knew of the whole
affair, from the time I first saw the shadows until
the moment when I went down in the elevator and
met Mr. Pitt.</p>
<p>He listened with deepest attention, and then,
seemingly unimpressed by my story, began to question
Jenny.</p>
<p>This volatile young lady had regained her mental
balance, and was more than ready to dilate upon
her experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was sitting at my desk,
and nobody had come in for an hour or so, when,
all of a sudden, I heard talking in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do callers usually go through your room?&rdquo;
Mr. Talcott inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&mdash;that is, unless they&rsquo;re Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
personal friends,&mdash;like Miss Raynor or somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Raynor?&rdquo; I broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ward,&rdquo; said Mr. Talcott, briefly. &ldquo;Go on,
Jenny; nobody had gone through your room?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; and so, I was startled to hear somebody
scrapping with Mr. Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrapping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; sort of quarreling, you know; I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, sir, but I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing
the angry voices, though I didn&rsquo;t make out the
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Jenny,&rdquo; Talcott&rsquo;s tones were stern,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t assume more than you can be sure was
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t assume anything,&rdquo; said Jenny,
crisply, &ldquo;for I didn&rsquo;t hear a single word,&mdash;only I
did feel sure the two of &rsquo;em was scrapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard, then, angry voices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, just that. And right straight afterward,
a pistol shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Mr. Gately&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And then I ran in there to see what
it meant,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I didn&rsquo;t stop to think there was anything
to be frightened of. But when I got in there,
and saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&mdash;what did you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man, with a pistol in his hand, running out
of the door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which door?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The door of number three,&mdash;that&rsquo;s Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
own particular private room,&mdash;well, he was running
out of that door, with a pistol in his hand,&mdash;and
the pistol was smoking, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s foolish little face was red with excitement
and her lips trembled as she told her story.
It was impossible to disbelieve her,&mdash;there could be
no doubt of her fidelity to detail.</p>
<p>But Talcott was imperturbable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pistol was smoking,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;where
did the man go with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said Jenny; &ldquo;I ran out to
the hall after him,&mdash;I think I saw him run down
the staircase, but I,&mdash;I was so scared with it all, I
jumped into the elevator,&mdash;Minny&rsquo;s elevator,&mdash;and
came downstairs myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; prompted Talcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;I think I lost
my head&mdash;it was all so queer, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Talcott, soothingly,&mdash;he was a
most courteous man, &ldquo;yes, Miss Jenny,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
wonder you were upset. Now, I think, if you will
accompany us, we will go upstairs to Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Mr. Talcott did not pay
sufficient attention to my presence, but I forgave
this, because I felt sure he would be only too glad
to avail himself of my services later on. So I followed
him and the tow-headed Jenny up to the
offices of the bank president.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>We did not go up in Minny&rsquo;s elevator, but in
another one, and our appearance at the door of Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s office number one, was met by Norah,&mdash;my
Norah, who received us with an air of grave
importance.</p>
<p>She was unawed by the sight of Mr. Talcott,
imposing though he was, and was clearly scornful
of Jenny, who had already assumed a jaunty
manner.</p>
<p>But Jenny was quite self-possessed, and with a
toss of her head at Norah she started to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in here, at my desk, Mr. Talcott,&rdquo; she
began, volubly; &ldquo;and in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office, I heard
somebody talking pretty sharp&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get in, if not through your room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, people often went through the hall doors
of number two or three, and sometimes they came
through my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who went through your room this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three people. An old man named
Smith&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure, but it had to do with his
getting a part salary from Mr. Gately; he was a
down-and-outer, and he hoped Mr. Gately would
help him through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir! Mr. Gately always was soft-hearted
and never turned down anybody in need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other callers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was an old lady, to see about her husband&rsquo;s
pension,&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? I suppose not all the callers were beneficiaries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. One was a&mdash;a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady? Describe her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she was Miss Olive Raynor,&mdash;Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Raynor. Well, there&rsquo;s no use discussing
her. Were there any other ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor any other men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; that is, not through my room. You
know, people could go in to Mr. Gately&rsquo;s private
offices without going through my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But couldn&rsquo;t you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only dimly,&mdash;through the clouded glass window
between my room and Mr. Gately&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you see of the callers in Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s room just before you heard the shot
fired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny looked dubious. She seemed inclined not
to tell all she knew. But Mr. Talcott spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;speak up. Tell all you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anybody come in,&rdquo; said Jenny,
slowly; &ldquo;and then, all of a sudden, I heard loud
voices,&mdash;and then, I heard quarrelly words&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarrelly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, as if somebody was threatening Mr.
Gately. I didn&rsquo;t hear clearly, but I heard enough
to make me look through the window between the
two rooms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Jenny nodded at the clouded
glass pane between her room and Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office.
&ldquo;And I saw sort of shadows,&mdash;and then in
a minute I saw the shadows get up&mdash;you know, Mr.
Gately and another man,&mdash;and then,&mdash;I heard a
pistol fired off, and I yelled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your scream I heard, then!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jenny replied, &ldquo;but I did
scream, because I am fearfully scared of pistol shots,
and I didn&rsquo;t know who was shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do next?&rdquo; asked Mr. Talcott,
in his quiet way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran into Mr. Gately&rsquo;s room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you weren&rsquo;t frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for myself. I was frightened of the shot,&mdash;I
always am afraid of firearms, but I wanted to
know what was doing. So, I opened the door and
ran in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw nobody in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s room,&mdash;I mean
this room next to mine,&mdash;so I ran on, to the third
room,&mdash;I am not supposed to go in there,&mdash;but I
did, and there I saw a man just going out to the
hall and in his hand was a smoking revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out to the hall? Did you follow him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did! But he ran down the staircase.
I didn&rsquo;t go down that way, because I thought
I&rsquo;d get down quicker and head him off by going
down in the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you went down in the elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It was Minny&rsquo;s elevator,&mdash;Minny&rsquo;s
my sister,&mdash;and after I got in,&mdash;and saw Minny, I
got sort of hysterical and nervous, and I couldn&rsquo;t
remember what I was about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the man?&rdquo; asked Talcott, uninterested
in Jenny&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. I was so rattled,&mdash;and I
only saw him a moment,&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know him if you saw him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could say yes,&mdash;it may be of gravest
importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jenny seemed to resent Mr. Talcott&rsquo;s
desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could expect it, sir,&rdquo; she
said, pettishly; &ldquo;I saw him only in a glimpse,&mdash;I
was scared to death at the sound of the pistol shot,&mdash;and
when I burst into this room and found Mr.
Gately gone I was so kerflummixed I didn&rsquo;t know
what I was about! That I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Norah remarked, quietly, &ldquo;after you
went downstairs and these gentlemen found you in
the lunchroom, you were perfectly calm and collected&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; blazed back Jenny;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all on edge! My nerves are completely unstrung!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Talcott, kindly, &ldquo;and I
suggest that you go back to the lunchroom, Miss
Jenny, and rest and calm yourself. But please remain
there, until I call for you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny looked a little disappointed at being thus
thrust out of the limelight, but as Mr. Talcott held
the door open for her, she had no choice but to
depart, and we presently heard her go down in her
sister&rsquo;s elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Mr. Talcott resumed, &ldquo;we will look
into this matter further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he proceeded, speaking, to my surprise,
as much to Norah as to myself, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
really apprehend that anything serious has happened
to Mr. Gately. For, if the shot which Jenny
heard, and which you, Mr. Brice, heard,&mdash;had
killed Mr. Gately, the body, of course, would be
here. Again, if the shot had wounded him seriously,
he would in some way contrive to make his
condition known. Therefore, I feel sure that Mr.
Gately is either absolutely all right, or, if slightly
wounded, he is in some anteroom or in some
friend&rsquo;s room nearby. And, if this is the case,&mdash;I
mean, if our Mr. Gately is ill or hurt, we must
find him. Therefore, careful search must be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; spoke up Norah, &ldquo;perhaps Mr. Gately
went home. There is no positive assurance that he
did not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Mr. Talcott looked at Norah keenly. He didn&rsquo;t
seem to regard her as an impertinent young person,
but he took her suggestion seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I think I will call
up his residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and I gathered from the remarks he
made on the telephone that Amos Gately was not
at his home, nor was his niece, Miss Olive Raynor,
there.</p>
<p>Talcott made another call or two, and I finally
learned that he had located Miss Raynor.</p>
<p>For, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shall hope to see
you here in ten or fifteen minutes, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver,&mdash;he had used the instrument
in Jenny&rsquo;s room, and not the upset one
on Mr. Gately&rsquo;s desk,&mdash;and he vouchsafed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is all right. Miss Raynor says she
saw her uncle here this afternoon, shortly after
luncheon, and he said he was about to leave the
office for the day. She thinks he is at his club or
on the way home. However, she is coming around
here, as she is in the limousine, and fearing a storm,
she wants to take Mr. Gately home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />The Elevator</h2>
<p>Mr. Talcott returned to the middle room
and looked more carefully at the disturbed
condition of things around and on Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certain that Mr. Gately left the room in
haste,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for here is what is undoubtedly
a private and personal checkbook left open. I shall
take on myself the responsibility of putting it
away, for the moment, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Talcott closed the checkbook and put it in
a small drawer of the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put away that hatpin, too?&rdquo;
suggested Norah, eying the pin curiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think it belongs to Miss Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it up by the edge,&rdquo; I warned; &ldquo;I may be
jumping to conclusions, but there is a possibility
that a crime has been committed, and we must preserve
what <i>may</i> be evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; agreed Talcott, and
he gingerly picked up the pin by taking the edges
of its ornate head between his thumb and forefinger.
The head was an Egyptian scarab,&mdash;whether
a real one or not I couldn&rsquo;t tell,&mdash;and was
set on a flat backing of gold. This back might
easily retain the thumb print of the woman who
had drawn that pin from her hat in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
office. And who, Norah surmised, was the person
who had fired the pistol that I had heard discharged.</p>
<p>Placing the hatpin in the drawer with the checkbook,
Mr. Talcott locked the drawer and slipped
the key in his pocket.</p>
<p>I wondered if he had seen some entry in the book
that made him wish to hide Mr. Gately&rsquo;s private
affairs from curious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is indeed a possibility of something
wrong,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;at first I couldn&rsquo;t think it,
but seeing this room, that overturned chair and
upset telephone, in connection with the shooting,
as you heard it, Mr. Brice, it certainly seems ominous.
And most mysterious! Two people quarreling,
a shot fired by one or other of them, and
no sign of the assailant, his victim, or his weapon!
Now, there are three propositions, one of which
<i>must</i> be the truth. Mr. Gately is alive and well,
he is wounded, or he is killed. The last seems impossible,
as his body could not have been taken
away without discovery; if he were wounded, I
think that, too, would have to be known; so, I still
feel that things are all right. But until we can
prove that, we must continue our search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;search for Mr. Gately and
also, search for the man who was here and who
quarreled with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the woman,&rdquo; insisted Norah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think it was a woman,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Although
the shadow was indistinct, it struck me as
that of a man, the motions and attitudes were masculine,
as I recall them. The hatpin may have been
left here this morning or any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The visitor must be found,&rdquo; declared Mr. Talcott,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how to go about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask the elevator girls,&rdquo; I suggested; &ldquo;one of
them must have brought the caller up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did this, but the attendants of the three elevators
all denied having brought anyone up to Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s offices since the old man and the elderly
lady who had been mentioned by Jenny.</p>
<p>Miss Raynor had been brought up by one of the
girls also, but we couldn&rsquo;t quite ascertain whether
she had come before or after the other two.</p>
<p>While waiting for Miss Raynor to come again,
I tried to do a little scientific deduction from any
evidence I might notice.</p>
<p>But I gained small information. The desk-blotter,
inkwell, and pens were in immaculate order,
doubtless they were renewed every day by a careful
attendant. All the minor accessories, such as
paperweights and letter openers were of individual
styles and of valuable materials.</p>
<p>There was elaborate smoking paraphernalia and
a beautiful single rose in a tall silver vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you read anything bearing on the mystery,
Mr. Brice,&rdquo; asked Talcott, noting my thoughtful
scrutiny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; nothing definite. In fact, nothing of any
importance. I see that on one occasion, at least,
Mr. Gately kept a chauffeur waiting an unconscionably
long time, and the man was finally obliged
to go away without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, how do you guess that?&rdquo; and Mr.
Talcott looked decidedly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like most of those spectacular deductions,&rdquo; I
responded, &ldquo;the explanation takes all the charm
out of it. There is a carriage check on the desk,&mdash;one
of those queer cards with a lot of circular holes
in it. That must have been given to Mr. Gately
when he left his car, or perhaps a taxicab, outside
of some hotel or shop. As he didn&rsquo;t give it up,
the chauffeur must have waited for him until he
was tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have gone off with some friend, and
sent word to the man not to wait,&rdquo; offered
Talcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then he would have sent the call-check
out to identify him. What a queer-looking thing
it is,&rdquo; and I picked up the card, with its seven
round holes in a cabalistic array.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the caller left it,&rdquo; spoke up Norah;
&ldquo;perhaps he, or she, came here in a cab, or a car,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Norah,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;such checks are not given
out at a building of this sort. Only at hotels,
theaters, or shops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no importance,&rdquo; and Mr. Talcott gave
a slight shrug of impatience; &ldquo;the thing is, where
is Mr. Gately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Restless and unable to sit still, I wandered into
the third room. I had heard of this sanctum, but
I had never expected to see inside of it. The impulse
came to me now to make the most of this
chance, for when Mr. Gately returned I might be
summarily, if courteously, ejected.</p>
<p>The effect of the room was that of dignified
splendor. It had evidently been done but not overdone
by a decorator who was a true artist. The
predominant color was a soft, deep blue, and the
rugs and textile fabrics were rich and luxurious.
There were a few fine paintings in gold frames
and the large war map occupied the greater part
of a paneled wall space. The chairs were spacious
and cushioned, and a huge davenport stood in front
of a wide fireplace, where some logs were cheerily
burning.</p>
<p>A cozy place to entertain friends, I ruminated,
and then, turning back to the middle room, I reconstructed
the movements of the two people I had
seen shadowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they rose,&rdquo; I said to Mr. Talcott, &ldquo;Amos
Gately was behind this big table-desk, and the other
man,&mdash;for I still think it was a man,&mdash;was opposite.
The other man upset his chair, on rising, so he must
have risen hastily. Then the shot was fired, and
the two disappeared. As Jenny came into the room
at once, and saw the strange man going through the
third room and on out to the stairs, we are forced
to the conclusion that Mr. Gately preceded
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down the stairs?&rdquo; asked Mr. Talcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the flight, at least, or Jenny would
have seen him. Also, I should have seen him, had
he remained in this hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the woman?&rdquo; asked Norah, &ldquo;what became
of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was any woman present at
that time,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;The hatpin was, doubtless,
left by a woman caller, but we&rsquo;ve no reason to
suppose she was there at the same time the shooting
occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any reason why anyone should
shoot Mr. Gately,&rdquo; said Talcott, musingly. &ldquo;He is
a most estimable gentleman, the soul of honor and
uprightness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I assented; &ldquo;but has he no personal
enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I know of, and it is highly improbable,
anyway. He is not a politician, or, indeed, a
public man of any sort. He is exceedingly charitable,
but he rarely makes known his good deeds. He
has let it be known that he wishes his benefactions
kept quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are his tastes?&rdquo; I asked, casually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Simple in the extreme. He rarely takes a
vacation, and though his home is on a magnificent
scale, he doesn&rsquo;t entertain very much. I have heard
that Miss Raynor pleads in vain for him to be more
of a society man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is his ward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; no relation, although she calls him uncle.
I believe he was a college chum of Miss Raynor&rsquo;s
father, and when the girl was left alone in the
world, he took her to live with him, and took charge
of her fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A large one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly so, I believe. Enough to tempt the fortune-hunters,
anyway, and Mr. Gately frowns on
any young man who approaches him with a request
for Olive Raynor&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the caller today was a suitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hardly think a man would come armed
on such an errand. No; to me, the most mysterious
thing about it all, is why anyone should desire to
harm Mr. Gately. It must have been a homicidal
maniac,&mdash;if there is really such a being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most mysterious part to me,&rdquo; I rejoined,
&ldquo;is how they both got away so quickly. You see,
I stood in my doorway opposite, looking at them,
and then as soon as I heard the shot I ran to the
middle door as fast as I could, then to the third
room door, and then back to the first. Of course,
had I known which room was which, I should have
gone to door number one first. But, as you see, I
was in the hall, going from one door to another,
and I must have seen the men if they came out into
the hall from any door.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They left room number three, as you entered
number one,&rdquo; said Norah, carefully thinking it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be so, but where did they go? Why,
if Mr. Gately went downstairs, has he not been
visible since? I can&rsquo;t help feeling that Amos
Gately is unable to move, for some reason or other.
May he have been kidnaped? Or is he bound and
gagged in some unused room, say on the floor
below this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Talcott, briefly. &ldquo;Without saying
anything about it I put one of the bank clerks on
the hunt and I told him to look into every room in
the building. As he has not reported, he hasn&rsquo;t yet
found Mr. Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, Olive Raynor arrived.</p>
<p>I shall never forget that first sight of her. Heralded
by a fragrant whiff of fresh violets, she came
into the first room, and paused at the doorway of
the middle room, where we still sat.</p>
<p>Framed in the mahogany door-casing, the lovely
bit of femininity seemed a laughing bundle of furs,
velvets, and laces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said a soft, sweet voice.
&ldquo;Has Uncle Amos run away? I hope he is in a
sheltered place for there&rsquo;s a ferocious storm coming
up and the wind is blowing a gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nodding plumes on her hat tossed as she
raised her head inquiringly and looked about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I smell?&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like&mdash;like
pistol-smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mr. Talcott said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no pistol
here now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How exciting! What&rsquo;s it all about? Do tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly the girl apprehended no serious matter.
Her wide-open eyes showed curiosity and interest,
but no thought of trouble had as yet come to her.</p>
<p>She stepped further into the room, and throwing
back her furs revealed a slender graceful figure,
quick of movement and of exquisite poise. Neither
dark nor very fair, her wavy brown hair framed a
face whose chief characteristic seemed to be its
quickly changing expressions. Now smiling, then
grave, now wondering, then merry, she looked from
one to another of us, her big brown eyes coming
to rest at last on Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, with a lovely smile
that robbed the words of all curtness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Norah MacCormack, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; my
stenographer replied. &ldquo;I am in Mr. Brice&rsquo;s office,
across the hall. This is Mr. Brice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reason why Norah should be the
one to introduce me, but we were all a little rattled,
and Mr. Talcott, who, of course, was the one to
handle the situation, seemed utterly at a loss as to
how to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Brice?&rdquo; and Miss Raynor
flashed me a special smile. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Talcott,
tell me what&rsquo;s the matter? I see something
has happened. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>She was grave enough now. She had suddenly
realized that there was something to tell, and she
meant to have it told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; Talcott began,
&ldquo;whether anything has happened, or not. I mean,
anything serious. We&mdash;that is,&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know
where Mr. Gately is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on. That of itself doesn&rsquo;t explain your
anxious faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Talcott told her,&mdash;told her just what we knew
ourselves, which was so little and yet so mysterious.</p>
<p>Olive listened, her great, dark eyes widening with
wonder. She had thrown off her fur coat and was
seated in Amos Gately&rsquo;s desk-chair, her dainty foot
turning the chair on its swivel now and then.</p>
<p>Her muff fell to the floor, and, unconsciously,
she drew off her gloves and dropped them upon it.
She said no word during the recital, but her vivid
face showed all the surprise and fear she felt as the
tale was told.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said, simply.
&ldquo;Do you think somebody shot Uncle Amos? Then
where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand, either,&rdquo; returned Talcott.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that anybody shot him. We
only know a shot was fired and Mr. Gately is
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a man entered Jenny&rsquo;s room, from the
hall. He, too, paused in the doorway to the middle
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Amory, come in!&rdquo; cried Miss Raynor.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here. This is Mr. Brice,&mdash;and
Miss MacCormack,&mdash;Mr. Manning. Mr. Talcott,
of course you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never met Amory Manning before, but one
glance was enough to show how matters stood between
him and Olive Raynor. They were more
than friends,&mdash;that much was certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Manning downstairs,&rdquo; Miss Raynor
said to Talcott, with a lovely flush, &ldquo;and&mdash;as Uncle
Amos doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, he isn&rsquo;t just crazy over him,
I asked him not to come up here with me, but to
wait for me downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you were so long about coming down,
I came up,&rdquo; said Mr. Manning, with a little smile.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this,&mdash;what about a shot? Where&rsquo;s Mr.
Gately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talcott hesitated, but Olive Raynor poured out
the whole story at once.</p>
<p>Manning listened gravely, and at the end, said
simply: &ldquo;He <i>must</i> be found. How shall we set
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Talcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; said Olive, briskly. &ldquo;I refuse to believe
any harm has come to him. Let&rsquo;s call up his
clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done that,&rdquo; said Talcott. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think
he went away anywhere&mdash;willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, then?&rdquo; cried Olive. &ldquo;Oh, wait a minute,&mdash;I
know something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Talcott and I together, for the
girl&rsquo;s face glowed with her sudden happy thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Amos has a private elevator of
his own. He went down in that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked Manning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Olive looked about the
room. &ldquo;And Uncle forbade me ever to mention
it,&mdash;but this is an emergency, isn&rsquo;t it? and I&rsquo;m justified,&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Manning; &ldquo;tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all I do know. There is a secret
elevator that nobody knows about. Surely you can
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely we can!&rdquo; said I, and jumping up, I began
the search.</p>
<p>Nor did it take long. There were not very many
places where a private entrance could be concealed,
and I found it behind the big war map, in the third
room.</p>
<p>The door was flush with the wall, and painted
the same as the panel itself. The map simply hung
on the door, but overlapped sufficiently to hide it.
Thus the door was concealed, though not really
difficult of discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t open,&rdquo; I announced after a futile trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Automatic,&rdquo; said Talcott. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t open
that kind, when the car is down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the car is down?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because the door won&rsquo;t open. Well, it does
seem probable that Mr. Gately went away by this
exit, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the woman, too,&rdquo; remarked Norah.</p>
<p>As before Mr. Talcott didn&rsquo;t object to Norah&rsquo;s
participation in our discussion, in fact, he seemed
rather to welcome it, and in a way, deferred to her
opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;Now, Miss Raynor,
where does this elevator descend to? I mean,
where does it open on the ground floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; and the girl looked
perplexed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been up or down in it. I
shouldn&rsquo;t have known of it, but once Uncle let slip
a chance reference to it, and when I asked him
about it, he told me, but told me not to tell. You
see, he uses it to get away from bores or people
he doesn&rsquo;t want to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be easy to trace its shaft down
through the floors,&rdquo; said Amory Manning.
&ldquo;Though I suppose there&rsquo;s no opening on any floor
until the street floor is reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manning was a thoughtful-looking chap.
Though we had never met before, I knew of him
and I had an impression that he was a civil engineer
or something like that. I felt drawn to him
at once, for he had a pleasant, responsive manner
and a nice, kindly way with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>In appearance, he was scholarly, rather than
business-like. This effect was probably due in part
to the huge shell-rimmed glasses he wore. I can&rsquo;t
bear those things myself, but some men seem to
take to them naturally. For the rest, Manning had
thick, dark hair, and he was a bit inclined to stoutness,
but his goodly height saved him from looking
stocky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we ought to investigate this elevator,&rdquo;
said Talcott. &ldquo;Suppose you and I, Mr.
Brice, go downstairs to see about it, leaving Miss
Raynor and Mr. Manning here,&mdash;in case,&mdash;in case
Mr. Gately returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that Talcott meant, in case we should find
anything wrong in the elevator, but he put it the
more casual way, and Miss Raynor seemed
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll wait here till
you come back. Of course, you can find where it
lands, and&mdash;oh, wait a minute! Maybe it opens in
the next door building. I remember, sometimes
when I&rsquo;ve been waiting in the car for Uncle, he has
come out of the building next door instead of this
one, and when I asked him why, he always turned
the subject without telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; and Talcott considered the position
of the shaft. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah discreetly returned to my offices, but I felt
pretty sure she wouldn&rsquo;t go home, until something
was found out concerning the mysterious disappearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>On the street floor we could find no possible
outlet for the elevator in question, and had it not
been for Olive&rsquo;s hint as to where to look, I don&rsquo;t
know how we should have found it at all.</p>
<p>But on leaving the Trust Company Building, we
found the place at last. At least, we found a door
which was in the position where we supposed the
elevator shaft would require it, and we tried to
open it.</p>
<p>This we failed to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks bad,&rdquo; said Talcott, shaking his head.
&ldquo;If Amos Gately is in there, it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s unable
to get out&mdash;or&mdash;unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to speak the crueler
word that was in both our minds, and he turned
abruptly aside, as he went in search of the janitor
or the superintendent of the building.</p>
<p>Left by myself I stared at the silent door. It
was an ordinary-looking door, at the end of a small
side passage which communicated with the main
hall or lobby of the building. It was inconspicuous,
and as the passage had an angle in it, Amos Gately
could easily have gone in and out of that door
without exciting comment.</p>
<p>Of course, the janitor would know all about it;
and he did.</p>
<p>He returned with Mr. Talcott, muttering as he
came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always said Mr. Gately&rsquo;d get caught in that
thing yet! I don&rsquo;t hold with them automaticky
things, so I don&rsquo;t. They may go all right for years
and then cut up some trick on you. If that man&rsquo;s
caught in there, he must be pretty sick by this
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Gately use the thing much?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very often, sir. Irregular like. Now,
quite frequent, and then, again, sort of seldom.
Well, we can&rsquo;t open it, Mr. Talcott. These things
won&rsquo;t work, only just so. After anybody gets in,
and shuts the door, it can&rsquo;t be opened except by
pressing a button on the inside. Can&rsquo;t you get in
upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Talcott, shortly. &ldquo;Get help, then,
and break the door down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, the splintered door fell away,
and there, in a crumpled heap on the floor of the
car, was Amos Gately,&mdash;dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />The Black Squall</h2>
<p>If I had thought Mr. Talcott somewhat indifferent
before, I changed my opinion suddenly.
His face turned a ghastly white and his eyes
stared with horror. There was more than his
grief for a friend, though that was evident enough,
but his thoughts ran ahead to the larger issues involved
by this murder of a bank president and
otherwise influential financier.</p>
<p>For murder it was, beyond all doubt. The briefest
examination showed Mr. Gately had been shot
through the heart, and the absence of any weapon
precluded the idea of suicide.</p>
<p>The janitor, overcome at the sight, was in a
state bordering on collapse, and Mr. Talcott was
not much more composed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brice,&rdquo; he said, his face working convulsively,
&ldquo;this is a fearful calamity! What can it
mean? Who could have done it? What shall
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answering his last question first, I endeavored
to take hold of the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, Mr. Talcott, we must keep this
thing quiet for the moment. I mean, we must not
let a crowd gather here, before the necessary matters
are attended to. This passage must be
guarded from intrusion, and the bank people must
be notified at once. Suppose you and the janitor
stay here, while I go back next door and tell&mdash;tell
whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Talcott, passing
his hand across his forehead. &ldquo;Yes, please, Mr.
Brice, do that&mdash;go to the bank and tell Mr. Mason,
the vice-president&mdash;ask him to come here to me,&mdash;then,
there is Miss Raynor&mdash;oh, how horrible it
all is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, we must call a doctor,&rdquo; I suggested,
&ldquo;and, eventually, the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must they be brought in? Yes, I suppose so.
Well, Mr. Brice, if you will attend to those errands,
I will stay here. But we must shut up that
janitor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, on the verge of collapse, was groaning
and mumbling prayers, or something, as he rocked
his big body back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is a great
emergency and you must meet it and do your duty.
That, at present, is to stay here with Mr. Talcott,
and make sure that no one else comes into this
small hall until some of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s bank officers
arrive. Also, cease that noise you&rsquo;re making, and
see what you can do in the way of being a real
help to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>This appeal to his sense of duty was not without
effect, and he straightened up and seemed equal
to the occasion.</p>
<p>I ran off, then, and out of one big building back
into the other. The storm, still brewing, had not
yet broken, but the sky was black, and a feeling of
more snow was in the atmosphere. I shivered as I
felt the bitterly cold outside air, and hurried into
the bank building.</p>
<p>I had no trouble in reaching Mr. Mason, for the
bank itself was closed and many of the employees
had gone home. My manner of grave importance
sufficed to let me pass any inquisitive attendants
and I found Mr. Mason in his office.</p>
<p>I told him the bare facts in a few words, for
this was no time to tarry,&mdash;I wanted to get up
and tell Miss Raynor before any less considerate
messenger might reach her.</p>
<p>Mr. Mason was aghast at the terrible tidings,
and closing his desk at once, he quickly reached for
his hat and coat and started on his fearsome
errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call Mr. Gately&rsquo;s physician,&rdquo; he said, his
mind working quickly, as he paused a moment,
&ldquo;and you will break the news to Miss Raynor,
you say? I can&rsquo;t seem to comprehend it all! But
my place is by Mr. Gately and I will go there at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I hastened up to the twelfth floor again, trying,
on the way, to think how I should best tell
the awful story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The elevator ride had never seemed so short,&mdash;the
floors fairly flew past me, and in a few moments
I was in the beautiful third room of Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s, and found Miss Raynor and Mr. Manning
eagerly awaiting my news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found Mr. Gately?&rdquo; Amory Manning
asked, but at the same instant, Olive Raynor
cried out, &ldquo;You have something dreadful to tell
us, Mr. Brice! I know you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to help me, and I answered, &ldquo;Yes,
Miss Raynor,&mdash;the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For I felt that this imperious, self-possessed girl
would rather be told abruptly, like that, than to
have me mince matters.</p>
<p>And I was right, for she said, quickly, &ldquo;Tell
it all,&mdash;any knowledge is better than suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I told her, as gently as I could, of our discovery
of the body of Amos Gately in his private
elevator, at the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Manning.
&ldquo;Shot through the heart and alone in the
elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is. I&rsquo;ve no idea of the
details of the matter. We didn&rsquo;t move the body,
or examine it thoroughly, but the first glance
showed the truth. However, a doctor has been sent
for, and the vice-president and secretary of the
Trust Company have things in charge, so I came
right up here to tell you people about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I thank you, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; Olive&rsquo;s lovely
dark eyes gave me a grateful glance. &ldquo;What shall
I do, Amory? Shall we go down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manning hesitated. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said, looking at
her tenderly, &ldquo;but&mdash;do you want to? It will be
hard for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&mdash;but I must go. If Uncle Amos has
been killed&mdash;surely I ought to be there to&mdash;to&mdash;oh,
I don&rsquo;t know what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive Raynor turned a piteous face to Manning,
and he took her hand in his as he responded:
&ldquo;Come, if you think best, dear. Shall we go
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I dread it, but I must go.
And if you are with me I can stand it. What
are you going to do, Mr. Brice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to go home,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I
think I will go back to the Matteawan Building, for
I may be able to give assistance in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went across to my office and found that Norah
had gone home. Snapping on some lights, I sat
down for a few minutes to straighten out my bewildered,
galloping thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Here was I, Tom Brice, a quiet, inconspicuous
lawyer, thrown suddenly into the very thick of a
most mysterious murder case. I well knew that
my evidence concerning the shadows I had seen
would be eagerly listened to by the police, when
the time came, and I wondered how soon that
would be. I wanted to go home. I wanted to
avoid the coming storm and get into my cozy
rooms, and think the thing over. For, I had always
felt that I had detective ability, and now I had
been given a wonderful chance to prove it. I did
not intend to usurp anybody&rsquo;s prerogative nor did
I desire to intrude. If I were not asked to assist,
I should not offer; but I had a vague hope that my
early acquaintance with the vital facts would make
me of value as a witness and my mental acumen
would bring forth some original ideas in the way
of investigation.</p>
<p>And I wanted some time to myself, to cogitate,
and to formulate some theories already budding in
my brain. Now if the police were already on the
scene next door, they would not let me get away,
if I appeared.</p>
<p>And yet, I longed for further news of the proceedings.
So, I concluded to look in at the Matteawan,
and if that led me into the clutches of
the police inquisitors, I must submit. But, if I
could get away before their arrival, I should do
so. I was quite willing to be called upon by them,
and to tell all I knew, but I wanted to postpone
that until the next day, if possible.</p>
<p>Not wishing to obtrude my presence further on
Miss Raynor, I went down in an elevator without
returning to the Gately rooms. Indeed, I
didn&rsquo;t know whether she had gone down yet or
not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>But she had, and when I reached the scene, both
she and Manning were there and were consulting
with the men from the bank as to what should be
done.</p>
<p>The doctor came, too, and began to examine the
body.</p>
<p>The rest of us stood huddled in the narrow hall,
now grown hot and close, but we dared not open
the door to the main lobby, lest outsiders should
make their way in.</p>
<p>I asked the janitor if there were not some room
that could be used as a waiting place, but even as
he answered me, the doctor made his report.</p>
<p>It was to the effect that Amos Gately had been
shot before he entered the elevator or immediately
upon his entrance. That he had died instantly, and,
therefore it would seem that the body must have
been placed in the car and sent down by the assailant.
But this was only conjecture; all the
doctor could assert was that Mr. Gately had been
dead for perhaps an hour, and that the position of
the body on the floor indicated an instantaneous
death from a shot through the heart.</p>
<p>And then the janitor bestirred himself, and said
he could give us the use of a vacant office on the
ground floor, and we went in there,&mdash;all except the
doctor, who remained by the elevator.</p>
<p>Mr. Mason and Mr. Talcott agreed that the
police must be notified and they declared their
willingness to stay for their arrival. But the vice-president
told Miss Raynor she could go home if
she preferred to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait a while,&rdquo; she said, with the quick
decision that I found was habitual with her, &ldquo;the
car is still here,&mdash;oh, ought we not to tell Connor?
He&rsquo;s our chauffeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; volunteered Manning. &ldquo;I have
to go now, I&rsquo;ve an important matter to attend to
before six o&rsquo;clock. Olive, may I come up to the
house this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so glad to
have you. Come early, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Manning, and after pausing for
some further talk with the doctor he went away.</p>
<p>I tarried, wondering if I might go also, or if I
were needed there.</p>
<p>But as Mason and Talcott were deeply engrossed
in a low-toned conversation and as Miss Raynor
was waiting an opportunity to confer with the
doctor, who was their family physician, I concluded
I might as well go home while I was free
to do so.</p>
<p>So without definite adieux, but with a word to
Miss Raynor that she might command my services
at any time, I started for home.</p>
<p>The long expected storm had begun, and enormous
snowflakes were falling thickly.</p>
<p>As I left the Matteawan, I discerned Amory
Manning talking to the chauffeur of a big limousine
and knew that he was telling Amos Gately&rsquo;s man
what had happened to his master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>I slowed up, hoping Manning would get through
the interview and walk along, and I would join
him.</p>
<p>When he left the chauffeur, however, he darted
across the street, and though I followed quickly, I
almost lost sight of him in the blinding snowfall.</p>
<p>I called out to him, but he didn&rsquo;t hear, and small
wonder, for the wind roared and the traffic noises
were deafening.</p>
<p>So I hurried after him, still hoping to overtake
him.</p>
<p>And I did, or, at least, when he finally boarded
a Southbound car on Third Avenue, I hopped on
the same car.</p>
<p>I had intended taking a Madison Avenue car,
but there was none in sight, and I felt pretty sure
there was a blockade on the line. The streets
showed snowpiles, black and crusted, and the
street cleaners were few and far apart.</p>
<p>The car Manning and I managed to get onto
was crowded to the doors. We both stood, and
there were just too many people between us to make
conversation possible, but I nodded across and between
the bobbing heads and faces, and Manning
returned my greeting.</p>
<p>Stopping occasionally to let off some struggling,
weary standees and to take on some new snow-besprinkled
stampeders, we at last reached Twenty-second
Street, and here Manning nodded a farewell
to me, as he prepared to leave by the front end of
the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>This was only three blocks from my own destination,
and I determined to get off, too, still anxious
to speak to him regarding the scene of tragedy we
had just left.</p>
<p>So I swung off the rear end of the car, and it
moved on through the storm.</p>
<p>I looked about for Manning, but as I stepped to
the ground a gust of wind gave me all I could do
to preserve my footing. Moreover, it sent a flurry
of snowflakes against my glasses, which rendered
them almost opaque.</p>
<p>I dashed them clear with my gloved hand, and
looked for my man, but he was nowhere to be
seen from where I stood in the center of the four
street corners.</p>
<p>Where could Manning have disappeared to?
He must have flown like the wind, if he had already
darted either up or down Third Avenue or
along Twenty-second Street in either direction.</p>
<p>However, those were the only directions he could
have taken, and I concluded that as I struggled to
raise my umbrella and was at the same time partially
blinded by my snowed-under glasses, he had
hurried away out of sight. Of course, he had no
reason to think I was trying to catch up with him,
indeed, he probably did not know that I also left
the car, so he had no need for apology.</p>
<p>And yet, I couldn&rsquo;t see how he had disappeared
with such magical celerity. I asked a street cleaner
if he had seen him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; he said, blowing on his cold fingers,
&ldquo;naw, didn&rsquo;t see nobody. Can&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; in this
here black squall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just what it was. A sudden fierce
whirlwind, a maelstrom of tossing flakes, and a
black lowering darkness that seemed to envelop
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad Mary,&rdquo; the great clock nearby, boomed
out five solemn notes that somehow added to the
weirdness of the moment, and I grasped my umbrella
handle, pushed my glasses more firmly into
place, and strode toward my home.</p>
<p>With some, home is where the heart is, but, as
I was still heart-whole and fancy-free, I had no
romantic interest to build a home around, and my
home was merely two cozy, comfy rooms in the
vicinity of Gramercy Park.</p>
<p>And at last I reached them, storm-tossed, weary,
cold, and hungry, all of which unpleasant conditions
were changed for the better as rapidly as I could
accomplish it.</p>
<p>And when, finally, I found myself seated, with
a lighted cigar, at my own cheery reading table, I
congratulated myself that I had come home
instead of remaining at the Matteawan
Building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>For, I ruminated, if the police had corralled me
as witness, and held me for one of their protracted
queryings, I might have stayed there until late into
the night or even all night. And the storm, still
howling outside my windows, made me glad of
warmth and shelter.</p>
<p>Then, too, I was eager to get my thoughts in
order. I am of a methodical mentality, and I
wanted to set down in order the events I had experienced
and draw logical and pertinent deductions
therefrom.</p>
<p>I greatly wished I had had a few moments&rsquo; chat
with Amory Manning. I wanted to ask him some
questions concerning Amos Gately that I didn&rsquo;t like
to ask of the bank men. Although I knew Gately&rsquo;s
name stood for all that was honorable and impeccable
in the business world, I had not forgotten the
hatpin on his desk, nor the queer smile on Jenny&rsquo;s
face as she spoke of his personal callers.</p>
<p>I am not one to harbor premature or unfounded
suspicions of my fellow creatures, but</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>A little nonsense, now and then,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Is relished by the best of men,</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And Amos Gately may not have been above enjoying
some relaxations that he felt no reason to
parade.</p>
<p>But this was speculation, pure and simple, and
until I could ask somebody concerning Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
private life, I had no right to surmise anything
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Carefully, I went over all I knew about the
tragedy from the moment when I had opened my
outer office door ready to start for home. Had I
left a few moments sooner, I should probably
never have known anything much of the matter
except what I might learn from the newspapers or
from the reports current among the tenants of the
Puritan Building.</p>
<p>As it was, and from the facts as I marshaled
them in order before my mind, I believed I had
seen shadowed forth the actual murder of Amos
Gately. A strange thing, to be an eye-witness, and
yet to witness only the shadows of the actors in
the scene!</p>
<p>I strove to remember definitely the type of man
who did the shooting. That is, I supposed he did
the shooting. As I ruminated, I realized I had no
real knowledge of this. I saw the shadowed men
rise, clinch, struggle, and disappear. Yes, I was
positive they disappeared from my vision before
I heard the shot. This argued, then, that they
wrestled,&mdash;though I couldn&rsquo;t say which was attacker
and which attacked,&mdash;then they rushed to
the next room, where the elevator was concealed
by the big map; and then, in that room, the shot
was fired that ended Amos Gately&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>This must be the truth, for I heard only one
shot, and it must have been the fatal one.</p>
<p>Then, I could only think that the murderer had
deliberately,&mdash;no, not deliberately, but with exceeding
haste,&mdash;had put his victim in the elevator and
sent the inert body downstairs alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>This proved the full knowledge of the secret
elevator on the part of the assassin, so he must
have been a frequenter of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s rooms, or,
at least had been there before, and was sufficiently
intimate to know of the private exit.</p>
<p>To learn the man&rsquo;s identity then, one must look
among Mr. Gately&rsquo;s personal friends,&mdash;or, rather,
enemies.</p>
<p>I began to feel I was greatly handicapped by my
utter ignorance of the bank president&rsquo;s social or
home life. But it might be that in the near future
I should again see Miss Raynor, and perhaps in
her home, where I could learn something of her
late uncle&rsquo;s habits.</p>
<p>But, returning to matters I did know about, I
tried hard to think what course of procedure the
murderer probably adopted after his crime.</p>
<p>And the conclusion I reached was all too clear.
He had, of course, gone down the stairs, as Jenny
had said, for at least a few flights.</p>
<p>Then, I visualized him, regaining his composure,
assuming a nonchalant, business-like air, and stopping
an elevator on a lower floor, where he stepped
in, without notice from the elevator girl or the
other passengers.</p>
<p>Just as Rodman had entered from a middle floor,
when I was descending with Minny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Perhaps Rodman was the murderer! I knew him
slightly and liked him not at all. I had no earthly
reason to suspect him,&mdash;only,&mdash;he had got on, I remembered,
at the seventh floor, and his office was
on the tenth. This didn&rsquo;t seem terribly incriminating,
I had to admit, but I made a note of it, and
determined to look Mr. Rodman up.</p>
<p>My telephone bell rang, and with a passing wonder
at being called up in such a storm, I responded.</p>
<p>To my delight, it proved to be Miss Raynor
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for intruding, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she said,
in that musical voice of hers, &ldquo;but I&mdash;I am so
lonesome,&mdash;and there isn&rsquo;t anyone I want to
talk to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to me, then, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; I said, gladly.
&ldquo;Can I be of any service to you&mdash;in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so. I want to see you tomorrow.
Can you come to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. At what time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up in the morning,&mdash;that is, if it&rsquo;s perfectly
convenient for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; in the morning, then. About ten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please. They&mdash;they brought Uncle
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they? I&rsquo;m glad that was allowed. Are
you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I&rsquo;m frightfully lonely and desolate.
It&rsquo;s such a terrible night I wouldn&rsquo;t ask any of my
friends to come to stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expected Mr. Manning to call, I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did; but he hasn&rsquo;t come. Of course, the
reason is that it isn&rsquo;t a fit night for anyone to go
out. I telephoned his rooms, but he wasn&rsquo;t in. So
I don&rsquo;t know what to think. I&rsquo;d suppose he&rsquo;d telephone
even if he couldn&rsquo;t get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traffic must be pretty nearly impossible,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;it was awful going when I reached home
soon after five, and now, there&rsquo;s a young blizzard
raging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I couldn&rsquo;t expect him; and perhaps the
telephone wires are affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one isn&rsquo;t, at any rate, so chat with me as
long as you will. You can get some friend to
come to stay with you tomorrow, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I could have got somebody tonight,
but I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to ask it. I&rsquo;m all right, Mr.
Brice, I&rsquo;m not a very nervous person,&mdash;only, it is
sort of awful. Our housekeeper is a nice old
thing, but she&rsquo;s nearly in hysterics and I sent her
to bed. I&rsquo;ll say good-by now, and I&rsquo;ll be glad to
see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Olive Raynor</h2>
<p>I did see Miss Olive Raynor the next day, but
not in the surroundings of her own home as
I had expected.</p>
<p>For I received a rather peremptory summons to
present myself at police headquarters at a shockingly
early hour, and not long after my arrival
there, Miss Raynor appeared also.</p>
<p>The police had spent a busy night, and had unearthed
more or less evidence and had collected
quite a cloud of witnesses.</p>
<p>Chief of Police Martin conducted the inquiry,
and I soon found that my story was considered
of utmost importance, and that I was expected to
relate it to the minutest details.</p>
<p>This I did, patiently answering repeated questions
and asseverating facts.</p>
<p>But I could give no hint as to the identity, or
even as to the appearance of the man who quarreled
with Mr. Gately. I could, and did say that
he seemed to be a burly figure, or, at least, the
shadow showed a large frame and broad shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he a hat on?&rdquo; asked the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; and I should say he had either a large
head or thick, bushy hair, for the shadow showed
that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not see his face in profile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, it was only momentarily, and the clouded
glass of the door, in irregular waves, entirely prevented
a clear-cut profile view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after the two men rose, they disappeared
at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wrestled;&mdash;it seemed, I should say, that
Mr. Gately was grabbed by the other man, and
tried to make a getaway, whereupon the other man
shot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and the Chief
fixed me with his sharp blue eye, &ldquo;that you are not
reconstructing this affair in the light of the later
discovery of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought this over carefully before replying, and
then said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible I may have unconsciously
done so. But I distinctly saw the two
figures come together in a desperate struggle, then
disappear, doubtless into the third room, and then
I heard the shot. That is all I can state positively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, then, went right across the hall and tried
to enter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; tried to enter at the middle door, where
I had seen the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding that door fastened, I tried the third,
because the men had seemed to disappear in that
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The third room was also locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; or at least the door would not open
from the outside. Then I went back to the door
number one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that opened at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; had I tried that first, I should probably
have seen the men,&mdash;or the girl, Jenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Could you recognize the head of
the visitor if you should see it again shadowed
on the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure, but I doubt if I could. I
could tell if it were a very different type of head,
but if merely similar, I could not swear it was
the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. We must make the experiment. At
least it may give us a hint in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He questioned me further as to my knowledge
of Mr. Gately and his affairs, but when he found
I knew almost nothing of those and had been a
tenant of the Puritan Building but a very short
time he suddenly lost interest in me and turned his
attention to Miss Raynor.</p>
<p>Olive Raynor had come alone and unattended.
This surprised me, for I had imagined the young
ladies of the higher social circles never went anywhere
alone. But in many ways Miss Raynor
evinced her independence and self-reliance, and I
had no doubt a trusted chauffeur waited in her car
outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>She was garbed in black, but it was not the heavy
crape material that I supposed all women wore as
mourning. A long black velvet cape swathed the
slender figure in its voluminous folds, and as this
was thrown back, I saw her gown was of black
satin, with thinner black material used in combination.
Women&rsquo;s clothes, though a mystery to me,
had a sort of fascination for my ignorant eyes, and
I knew enough to appreciate that Miss Raynor&rsquo;s
costume was correct and very smart.</p>
<p>Her hat was black, too, smaller than the one I
saw her in the day before, and of a quieter type.</p>
<p>Altogether, she looked very lovely, and her sweet,
flower-like face, with its big, pathetic brown eyes,
was raised frankly to Chief Martin as she answered
his questions in a low, clear voice. A slight pallor
told of a night of wakefulness and sorrow, but this
seemed to accentuate the scarlet of her fine, delicate
lips,&mdash;a scarlet unacquainted with the assistance of
the rouge stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, positively, &ldquo;Mr. Gately had no
enemies, I am sure he hadn&rsquo;t! Of course, he may
have kept parts of his life or his affairs secret from
me, but I have lived with him too long and too
familiarly not to know him thoroughly. He was
of a simple, straightforward nature, and a wise and
noble gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you were not entirely fond of your uncle,&rdquo;
insinuated the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was not my uncle,&rdquo; returned Olive, calmly.
&ldquo;I called him that but he was no relation to me.
He used to be a college chum of my father&rsquo;s and
when both my parents died, he became not only my
guardian but my kind friend and benefactor. He
took me to live with him, and I have been his constant
companion for twelve years. During that
time, I have seen no act, have heard no word that
could in the slightest way reflect on his honor or
his character as a business man or as a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl spoke proudly, as though glad to pay
this tribute to her guardian, but still, there was no
note of affection in her voice,&mdash;no quiver of sorrow
at her loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you are not bowed with grief at his death,&rdquo;
observed Martin.</p>
<p>The dainty chin tilted in indignation. &ldquo;Mr.
Martin,&rdquo; Olive said, &ldquo;I cannot believe that my personal
feelings are of interest to you. I understand
I am here to be questioned as to my knowledge of
facts bearing on this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief nodded his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I must learn all I can of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
life outside his bank as well as in it. If you won&rsquo;t
give me information I must get it elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implied threat worked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed sorrow at Mr. Gately&rsquo;s tragic fate,&rdquo;
Olive said, gently. &ldquo;To be sure, he was not my
kin, but I admired and deeply respected him. If I
did not deeply love him it was his own fault. He
was most strict and tyrannical in his household,
and his lightest word was law. I was willing
enough to obey in many matters, but it annoyed and
irritated me when he interfered with my simplest
occupations or pleasures. He permitted me very
little company or amusement; he forbade many of
my friends the house; and he persistently refused to
let me accept attentions from men, unless they were
certain ones whom he preferred, and&mdash;whom I did
not always favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he favor Amory Manning?&rdquo; was the next
abrupt question.</p>
<p>Olive&rsquo;s cheeks turned a soft pink, but she replied
calmly. &ldquo;Not especially, though he had not forbidden
Mr. Manning the house. Why do you ask
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you noticed anything unusual lately about
Mr. Gately? Any nervousness or apprehension of
danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. He was of a most equable
temperament, and there has been no change of
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you last see him&mdash;alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon. I went to his office to
get some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has charge of your fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made no objection to your expenditures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. He was most just and considerate
in my financial affairs. He gave me then what I
asked for, and after a very short stay I went on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the house of a friend on Park Avenue,
where I spent most of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time were you in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. About two o&rsquo;clock, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me more positively? It may be
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Olive couldn&rsquo;t be sure whether she was there
before or after two. She had lunched late, and
had done some errands, and had finally reached her
friend&rsquo;s home by mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>This seemed to me most plausible, for society
young ladies do not always keep strict note of time,
but the Chief apparently thought it a matter of
moment and made notes concerning it.</p>
<p>Olive looked indifferent, and though she was
courteous enough, her whole manner betokened a
desire to get the examination over and to be allowed
to go home.</p>
<p>After a little further tedious questioning, which,
so far as I could see, elicited nothing of real importance,
the Chief sighed and terminated the
interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Mason and Mr. Talcott had by this time
arrived, and their presence was welcomed by Miss
Raynor, who was apparently glad of the nearness
of a personal friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Of course, their evidence was but a repetition of
the scenes I had been through the day before, but
I was deeply interested in the attitudes of the two
men.</p>
<p>Talcott, the secretary of the Trust Company, was
honestly affected by the death of his friend and
president, and showed real sorrow, while Mr.
Mason, the vice-president, was of a cold, precise
demeanor, seemingly far more interested in discovering
the murderer than appalled by the tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> learn who killed him,&rdquo; Mr. Mason
reiterated. &ldquo;Why, Chief Martin, if the police fail
to track down the slayer of Amos Gately, it will be
a blot on their record forever! Spare no effort,&mdash;put
your best men on the case, move heaven and
earth, if need be, but get your man! The Company
will back you to the full extent of its power;
we will offer a reward, when the suitable time
comes for that. But the crime must be avenged,
the man that shot President Gately <i>must</i> pay the
penalty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive&rsquo;s flashing eyes showed her sympathy with
this sort of talk and I could quite understand the
attitude of the girl, whose sense of justice cried out
for revenge, while she was forced to admit the deprivations
of her life with her guardian.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, the three went away together,
Miss Raynor and the men from the bank, but I
remained, hoping to learn more from further witnesses.
And I did. I learned so much that my
thoughts and theories were started off along totally
different lines; my half-formed beliefs were
knocked down and set up again, with swift continuance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>First, Jenny Boyd, the yellow ear-muffed stenographer
came in, wearing her Sunday clothes. Her
cheaply fashionable hat was tilted over her pert
little face, which showed enthusiastic, if ill-advised
application of certain pigments. Her gown was
V-necked and short-skirted, but it had a slight claim
to style and was undeniably becoming. Her air of
importance was such that I thought I had never
seen such an enormous amount of ego contained
in such a small cosmos.</p>
<p>Minny was with her, but the older sister, in
quieter attire, was merely a foil for the ebullient
Jenny. Also, they were accompanied by a big,
good-natured faced man, whom I recognized at once
as the janitor of the Matteawan Building, and who,
it transpired, was the father of the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he said, in a bluff, hearty way;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s me and my girls, and we&rsquo;d be obliged, Mr.
Chief, if you&rsquo;d cut it short as much as you can,
for me and Minny wants to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Boyd,&rdquo; and Chief Martin smiled
at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tackle you first. Tell us all about
that private elevator of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will, but savin&rsquo; for this murder business, not
a word of it would ever have crossed my lips.
Well, Mr. Gately, he owned the Matteawan, d&rsquo;you
see? and when it suited his purposes to put in a
private elevator up to his rooms on the top floor
of the next door building,&mdash;The Puritan Building,
you know,&mdash;what more easy than to run the shaft
up in the one building with the opening at the top
out into the other house. Anyways, that&rsquo;s what
he done,&mdash;a long time ago. I had to know of it, of
course,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, as superintendent of the Matteawan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it now, but I like better
to be called janitor. As janitor I began, and as
janitor I&rsquo;ll work to the end. Well, Mr. Gately, he
went up and down in the little car whenever he
chose, and no one noticed him at all. It wasn&rsquo;t,
after all, to say, secret, exactly, but it was a private
elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a concealed door in his own office makes
the thing pretty secret, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secret it is, then. But it&rsquo;s no crime for a man
to have a concealed way of gettin&rsquo; into or out of
his own rooms, is it? Many&rsquo;s the time Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s come down laughing fit to bust at the way
he got away from some old doddering fool who
wanted to buzz him to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frequently saw him come down, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to say frequently,&mdash;but now and again. If
I happened to be about at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anyone else use the elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, yes. I&rsquo;ve seen a few people go up
or come down,&mdash;but mostly it was the boss himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go up in it yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I seen. But, of course, he may have
done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he last come into his offices before&mdash;before
he disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he, Jenny? Speak up, girl, and tell
the Chief all you know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Martin had not addressed Jenny, he
turned to her now as if inviting her story.</p>
<p>And Jenny bridled, shook out her feather boa,
made a futile attempt to pull her brief skirt a trifle
farther down toward a silk-stockinged ankle, and
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, when Mr. Gately went into his
office he most gen&rsquo;ally went in the middle door,
right into his pers&rsquo;nal office. He didn&rsquo;t go through
my room. And, so, yest&rsquo;day, he went in the middle
door, but right away, almost, he opened my
door and stuck his head in, and says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let
anybody in to see me this afternoon, unless you
come and ask me first.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t this a general rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most always; but sometimes somebody I&rsquo;d
know&rsquo;d come, like Mr. Talcott or Miss Olive, and
they&rsquo;d just nod or smile at me and walk right in
at Mr. Gately&rsquo;s door. So I says, &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; and I
looked sharp that nobody rushed me. Mr. Gately,
he trusted me, and I was careful to do just what
he said, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on. Who called?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First, Mr. Smith; and then Mrs. Driggs; and
after them, Miss Olive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; and Jenny spoke flippantly.
&ldquo;I even announced her, &rsquo;cause I had strick orders.
Miss Olive, she just laughed and waited till I
come back and said she might go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say for sure. &rsquo;Long about two or
three, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny was assiduously chewing gum, and her
manner was far from deferential, which annoyed
the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to remember more nearly,&rdquo; he said, sharply.
&ldquo;Was Miss Raynor there before or after the other
two callers you mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, it&rsquo;s awful hard to tell that.&rdquo; Jenny
cocked her head on one side, and indulged in what
she doubtless considered most fetching eye-play.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a two-legged time-table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; advised the Chief. &ldquo;I
want straight answers, not foolishness, from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny sulked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; it to you as straight&rsquo;s
I can, Mr. Chief. Honest to goodness, I don&rsquo;t
know if Miss Olive was just before the Driggs hen
or after her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, be more careful of your choice of words.
Did Mrs. Driggs go back through your room when
she left?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess she did,&mdash;but,&mdash;lemmesee, no, I
guess she didn&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your memory very short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For such trifles, yes, sir. But I can remember
lots of things real easy. I&rsquo;ve got a date now,
with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! If you don&rsquo;t look out, young woman,
you&rsquo;ll be locked up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave pretty, now, Jenny girl,&rdquo; urged her
father, who was quite evidently the slave of his
resplendent offspring; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be flip; this here&rsquo;s no
place for such-like manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed the Chief, and
he glared at Jenny, who was utterly unmoved by
his sternness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t I behaving pretty?&rdquo; and the silly
thing giggled archly and folded her hands with an
air of mock meekness.</p>
<p>Continued harsh words from the Chief, however,
made her at last tell a straight and coherent story,
but it threw no light on the mysterious caller. In
fact, Jenny knew nothing whatever of him, save
that she saw or thought she saw him run downstairs,
with a pistol in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of hat did the man wear?&rdquo; asked
the Chief, to get some sort of description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;a soft hat, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a Derby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I do believe it <i>was</i> a Derby! And
he had on an overcoat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A dark one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;sort of&mdash;oh, I guess it wasn&rsquo;t an overcoat,&mdash;but
a, you know, Norfolk jacket, like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Norfolk, and no overcoat on a day like yesterday!
I don&rsquo;t believe you saw any man at all,
Jenny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, that&rsquo;s what I think sometimes,
Mr. Chief! It almost seems&rsquo;s if I dreamed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean! Don&rsquo;t you dare guy me,
miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; and Jenny&rsquo;s saucy face looked serious
enough now. &ldquo;But it was all so fearful sudden,
and I was so struck all of a heap, that I just can&rsquo;t
say what was so and what wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does seem to be your difficulty. You sit
over there and think the matter over, while I talk
to your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minny, a quiet, pretty girl, was as reticent as
Jenny was voluble. But after all, she had little to
tell. She had brought no one up in her elevator to
see Mr. Gately beside Miss Raynor that she knew
of except the man named Smith and Mrs. Driggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did these people all go down in your car, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. The cars were fairly crowded,
and I know Miss Raynor did not, but I&rsquo;m not so
sure about the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, Minny&rsquo;s evidence amounted to nothing,
either, for though she told of several strangers who
got on or off her car at various floors, she knew
nothing about them, and they could not be traced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>The three Boyds were quizzed a little more and
then old Joe Boyd, the father, and Minny were allowed
to go back to their respective posts, but the
Chief held Jenny for further grilling. He had a
hope, I felt sure, that he could get from her some
hint of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s personal affairs. He had
heard of the hatpin, and though he hadn&rsquo;t yet mentioned
it definitely, I knew he was satisfied it was
not Miss Raynor&rsquo;s, and he meant to put Jenny
through a mild sort of third degree.</p>
<p>I was about to depart, for I knew I would not
be invited to this session, and, too, I could learn the
result later.</p>
<p>Then an officer came in, and after a whispered
word to Chief Martin they beckoned to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Amory Manning?&rdquo; the Chief
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him yesterday for the first time,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;but I have known of him before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up around Gramercy Park somewhere, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, he does. Well, the man is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing! Why, I saw him last night,&mdash;that is,
yesterday afternoon, and he was all right then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had men searching for him all the morning,&rdquo;
the Chief went on, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s nowhere to be
found. He wasn&rsquo;t at his rooms at all last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>I harked back. I had last seen Manning getting
off the Third Avenue car at Twenty-second Street,&mdash;just
where he would naturally get off to go to
his home.</p>
<p>I told this, and concluded, &ldquo;he must have
changed his mind, then, and gone somewhere else
than to his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it looks that way,&rdquo; agreed the Chief.
&ldquo;But where did he go? That&rsquo;s the question. He
can&rsquo;t be found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />Clews</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t reach my office until afternoon, and
there I found Norah, in a brown study.</p>
<p>She looked up with a smile as I came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m neglecting my work,&rdquo; she said, with a
glance at a pile of papers, &ldquo;but that affair across
the hall has taken hold of me and I can&rsquo;t put it out
of my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can I. I feel as if I were deeply involved
in it,&mdash;if not indeed, an accessory! But there are
new developments. Mr. Manning is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manning? What has he got to do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the crime? Nothing. He didn&rsquo;t come
up here until Miss Raynor came, you know.
But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they will be, then. And don&rsquo;t worry
about Mr. Manning&rsquo;s absence. He&rsquo;ll not stay long
away from Miss Raynor. Who is he, anyway? I
mean what does he do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a civil engineer and he lives in Gramercy
Park. That&rsquo;s the extent of my knowledge of him.
I&rsquo;ve seen him down in the bank once or twice since
I&rsquo;ve been here, and I like his looks. I hope, for
Miss Raynor&rsquo;s sake, he&rsquo;ll turn up soon. She expected
him to call on her last evening and he didn&rsquo;t
go there at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think he would! Why, it was a
fearful night. I was going to the movies, but I
couldn&rsquo;t think of going out in that wild gale! But
never mind Mr. Manning now, let&rsquo;s talk about the
Gately affair. I want to go over there and look
around the office. Do you suppose they&rsquo;d let me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I expect so. Is anybody there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a police detective,&mdash;that man, Hudson.
You know they call him Foxy Jim Hudson, and I
suppose he&rsquo;s finding out a lot of stuff that isn&rsquo;t
so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a very high opinion of our arms
of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right,&mdash;but most detectives can&rsquo;t
see what&rsquo;s right under their noses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not omniscient Sherlocks, are they? And you
think you could do a lot of smarty-cat deduction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah didn&rsquo;t resent my teasing, but her gray eyes
were very earnest as she said, &ldquo;I wish I could try.
A woman was in that room yesterday afternoon;
someone besides Miss Raynor and the old lady
Driggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me over there and I&rsquo;ll show you. They&rsquo;ll
let me in, with you to back me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>We went across and the officer made no objections
to our entrance. In fact, he seemed rather
glad of someone to talk to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorta up against it,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;Our suspicions are all running in one direction,
and we don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a suspect, then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that, but we begin to think we know
which way to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any clews around, to verify your suspicions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;em. But take a squint yourself, Mr.
Brice. You&rsquo;re shrewd-witted, and&mdash;my old eyes
ain&rsquo;t what they used to was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took this mock humility for what it was worth,&mdash;nothing
at all,&mdash;and I humored the foxy one by
a properly flattering disclaimer.</p>
<p>But I availed myself of his permission and tacitly
assuming that it included Norah, we began a new
scrutiny of the odds and ends on Mr. Gately&rsquo;s desk,
as well as other details about the rooms.</p>
<p>Norah opened the drawer that Mr. Talcott had
locked,&mdash;the key was now in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the checkbook?&rdquo; she asked, casually.</p>
<p>Hudson looked grave. &ldquo;Mr. Pond&rsquo;s got that,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;Mr. Pond&rsquo;s Mr. Gately&rsquo;s lawyer, and he
took all his accounts and such. But that check-book&rsquo;s
a clew. You see the last stub in it shows
a check drawn to a woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it was a woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Norah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe,&mdash;maybe. Anyhow the check was
drawn <i>after</i> the ones made out to Smith and the
Driggs woman. So, the payee of that last check
was in here later than the other two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; was Norah&rsquo;s not unnatural
inquiry.</p>
<p>But Hudson merely looked at her, with a slight
smile that she should expect an answer to that
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;I see her hatpin
is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that there hatpin is a clew, you&rsquo;re welcome
to it. We don&rsquo;t think it is. Mr. Gately had frequent
lady callers, as any man&rsquo;s got a right to have,
but because they leaves their hatpins here, that
don&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em murderers. No, I argue that if a
woman shot Mr. Gately she would be cute
enough <i>not</i> to leave her hatpin by way of a visitin&rsquo;
card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This raised Hudson&rsquo;s mentality in my opinion,
and I could see it also scored with Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she generously agreed. &ldquo;In
books, as soon as I come to the dropped handkerchief
or broken cuff-link, I know that <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> the property
of the criminal. But, all the same, people do
leave clews,&mdash;why, Sherlock Holmes says a person
can&rsquo;t enter and leave a room without his presence
there being discoverable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poppycock,&rdquo; said Hudson, briefly, and resumed
his cogitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>He was sitting at ease in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s desk-chair,
but I could see the man was thinking deeply, and
as he had material for thought that he wasn&rsquo;t
willing to share with us, I returned to my own
searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something the lady left!&rdquo; I exclaimed,
as on a silver ash-tray I saw a cigarette stub, whose
partly burned gold monogram betokened it had
served a woman&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, let that alone!&rdquo; warned Hudson. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t be too previous; sometimes men have gilt-lettered
cigs, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without reply, I scrutinized the monogram. But
only a bit remained unburnt, and I couldn&rsquo;t make
out the letters.</p>
<p>Norah was digging in the waste basket, and, the
scamp! when Hudson&rsquo;s head was turned, she surreptitiously
fished out something which she hid in
her hand, and later transferred to her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; scoffed Hudson, as he turned
and saw her occupation, &ldquo;we been all through that,
and anything incriminating has been weeded out.
They wasn&rsquo;t much,&mdash;some envelopes and letters,
but nothing of any account. Oh, well, straws show
which way the wind blows, and we&rsquo;ve got some
several straws!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this one?&rdquo; and Norah pointed to the carriage
check, which still lay on the desk.</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="center">Carriage Check/The Electric Carriage Call Co.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Me and the Chief, we decided that
didn&rsquo;t mean nothing at all. It&rsquo;s old, you can see,
from its grimy look, so it wasn&rsquo;t left here yesterday.
Those things are always clean and fresh
when they&rsquo;re given out, and that&rsquo;s sorta soiled with
age, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>why</i> would a carriage
check be soiled with age? They&rsquo;re used the same
day they&rsquo;re given out. Why is it here, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hudson looked interested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Mr.
Brice,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I take it that there check
was given to Mr. Gately at some hotel, say. Well,
he didn&rsquo;t use it for some reason or other, and
brought it home in his pocket. But as you say,
why is it here? <i>Why</i> did he keep it? And, what
did he do with it to give it that thumbed, used
look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all examined the check. A bit of white cardboard,
about two by four inches in size, and pierced
with seven circular holes in irregular order. Across
the top was printed &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fold this card,&rdquo; and at
one end was the number 743 in large red letters.
Also, the right-hand upper corner was sliced off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a narrow strip of
paper pasted across the end, and&mdash;look,&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost
transparent! I can read through it&mdash;&lsquo;Hotel
St. Charles!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s where it came from!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses!&rdquo; and Hudson smiled condescendingly,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s where it <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> come from!
It came from any hotel <i>except</i> the St. Charles.
You may not know it, but often a hotel will use
electric call-checks of other hotels, with a slip of
paper pasted over the name. That&rsquo;s an item for
you to remember. No, Mr. Brice, I can&rsquo;t attach
any importance to that check, but I&rsquo;m free to confess
I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s there. Unless Mr. Gately
found it in his pocket after it had been there unnoticed
for some time. And yet, it is very much
thumbed, isn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s queer. Maybe he used
it for a bookmark, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the lady left it here,&rdquo; suggested Norah.
&ldquo;The same time she left her hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, maybe she did,&rdquo; and Foxy Jim Hudson
smiled benignly at her. &ldquo;Any ways, you&rsquo;ve made
the thing seem curious, and I guess I&rsquo;ll keep it for
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the card away in his pocketbook, and
Norah and I grinned at each other in satisfaction
that we had given him a clew to ponder over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; Hudson remarked,
after another period of silent thought, &ldquo;you missed
it, when you didn&rsquo;t fly in here quicker and catch
the murderer redhanded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known that the first door, Jenny&rsquo;s door,
was the only one I could open, of course I should
have gone there first. But I&rsquo;d never been in here
at all,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only been in the building a week or
so, and I <i>did</i> lose valuable time running from one
door to another. But I still think it&rsquo;s queer that I
didn&rsquo;t see anything of the man Jenny describes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One reason is, there wasn&rsquo;t any such man,&rdquo; and
Hudson seemed to enjoy my blank look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the murderer, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went down in the car with Mr. Gately. Private
elevator. Shot him on the way down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But man, I heard the shot,&mdash;and this room was
full of smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot him twice, then. Say the first time, Mr.
Gately wasn&rsquo;t killed and could get into the elevator.
Then murderer jumps in, too, and finishes the job
on the way down. It&rsquo;s a long trip to the ground
floor, you know. Then, murderer leaves elevator,
slams door shut, and walks off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ruminated on this. It seemed absurd on the
face of it, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did Jenny say she saw a man?&rdquo;
demanded Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she thought she did,&mdash;you know people
think they see what they think they ought to see.
Jenny heard a shot, and running in, she <i>expected</i>
to see a man with a pistol,&mdash;therefore, she thought
she <i>did</i> see him. Or, again, the girl is quite capable
of making up a yarn out of the solid. For the
dramatic effect, you know, and to put her silly little
self in the limelight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>This was not unbelievable. Jenny was most unreliable
as a witness. She stumbled and contradicted
herself as to the man&rsquo;s hat and had given
conflicting testimony about his overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I say, Mr. Brice, the chance was yours
to be on the spot but you missed it. Of course,
you are not to blame,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a pity. Now, s&rsquo;pose
you tell me again, as near as you can rec&rsquo;lect, about
that other shadow,&mdash;the one that wasn&rsquo;t Mr.
Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried hard to add to my previously related
details, but found it impossible to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, could it have been a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I should have said no, Mr. Hudson.
But on thinking it over, I suppose I may say it
<i>could</i> have been but I do not think it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know nowadays the women folks wear
their hair plastered so close to their heads that their
heads wouldn&rsquo;t shadow up any bigger&rsquo;n a man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; cried Norah. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s head is
smaller than a man&rsquo;s, but her hair makes it appear
larger in a shadow. Unless, as Mr. Hudson says,
she wore it wrapped round her head,&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t
have much, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go outside, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; directed Hudson,
&ldquo;and look at the shadows of me and Miss MacCormack,
and then come back and tell us what you
can notice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>I did this, and the two heads were shadowed
forth on the same door that I had watched the day
before. But the brighter daylight made the shadows
even more vague than yesterday, and I returned
without much information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell which was which, of course,&rdquo; I reported,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s true that if I hadn&rsquo;t known you
people at all, I could have mistaken Norah&rsquo;s head
for a man, and I might have believed, Hudson,
that you were a woman. It&rsquo;s surprising how little
individuality was shown in the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course they were clearer yesterday, as
the hall was darker,&rdquo; mused Hudson. &ldquo;After all,
Mr. Brice, your testimony can&rsquo;t amount to much
unless we can get the actual murderer behind that
glass, and some peculiar shape or characteristic
makes you recognize the head beyond all doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could do that,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;for
though I can&rsquo;t describe any peculiarity, I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;d recognize the <i>same</i> head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo; and Hudson looked at me keenly.
&ldquo;Well, perhaps we&rsquo;ll try you out on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had a definite suspect, then. And they
proposed to experiment with my memory. Well, I
was ready, whenever they were.</p>
<p>Norah and I went into the third room, Hudson
making no objection. At another time we would
have been deeply interested in the pictures and the
furnishings but now we had eyes and thoughts only
for one thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>We looked behind the war map and saw the elevator
door, but could not open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The car&rsquo;s down,&rdquo; spoke up Hudson, who was
watching us sharply. &ldquo;I dunno will it ever be
used again. Though I suppose these rooms will be
let to somebody else, some time. Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
things here will be sent to his house, I expect, but
his estate is a big one and will take a deal of settling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s his executor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pond, his lawyer. But his financial affairs
are all right. Nothing crooked about Amos Gately&mdash;financially.
You can bank on that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, then?&rdquo; I asked, for the tone implied a
mental reservation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying. But they do say every man
has a secret side to his life, and why should Mr.
Gately be a lone exception?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman?&rdquo; asked Norah, always harking back
to her basic suspicion.</p>
<p>Foxy Jim Hudson favored her with that blank
stare which not infrequently was his answer to an
unwelcome question, and which, perhaps, had a
share in earning him his sobriquet.</p>
<p>Then he laughed, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been reading
detective stories, miss. And you remember how
they always say &lsquo;Churches lay femmy!&rsquo; Well,
go ahead and church, if you like. But be prepared
for a sad and sorrowful result.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>The man was obviously deeply moved, and his
big, homely face worked with emotion.</p>
<p>But as he would tell us nothing further, and as
Norah and I had finished our rather unproductive
search of the rooms, we went back to my office.</p>
<p>Here Norah showed me what she had taken from
the waste basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it back to him, if you say so,&rdquo; she
offered; &ldquo;but he could do nothing with it, and
maybe I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a tiny scrap of pinkish paper, thin
and greatly crumpled. I took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Norah; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
it could show finger prints, but anyway, it&rsquo;s a sort
of a kind of a clew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; I asked, blankly, as I held
the crumpled paper gingerly in thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a powder-paper,&rdquo; vouchsafed Norah,
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A powder-paper. Women carry them,&mdash;they
come in little books. That&rsquo;s one of the leaves.
They&rsquo;re to rub on your face, and the powder comes
off on your nose or cheeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I never saw any before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of girls use them.&rdquo; Norah&rsquo;s clear, wholesome
complexion refuted any idea of her needing
such, and she spoke a bit scornfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Proving once more the presence of what
Friend Hudson calls a femmy,&rdquo; I smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but these things have great individuality,
Mr. Brice. This is of exceedingly fine quality, it
has a distinct, definite fragrance, and is undoubtedly
an imported article,&mdash;from France, likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they get such things over now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, it may have been imported before
the war. This quality would keep its odor forever!
Anyway, don&rsquo;t you believe we could trace
the woman who used it and left it there? It must
have happened yesterday, for the basket is, of
course, emptied every day in that office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl, Norah!&rdquo; and I nodded approval.
&ldquo;You are truly a She Sherlock! A bit intimate,
isn&rsquo;t it, for a woman to powder her nose in a man&rsquo;s
office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Old Fogey! Why, you can see
the girls doing that everywhere, nowadays. In the
street-cars, in the theater,&mdash;anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. How do you propose to proceed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go to the smartest Fifth Avenue
perfume shops and try to get a line on the maker
of this paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My door opened then, and the Chief of Police
stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come over, across the hall, Mr.
Brice?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I come?&rdquo; piped up Norah, and without
waiting for the answer, which, by the way, never
came, she followed us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have learned a great deal,&rdquo; began the
Chief, as I waited, inquiringly. &ldquo;And, now think
carefully, Mr. Brice, I want you to tell me if the
head you saw shadowed on the door, could by any
possibility have been a woman&rsquo;s head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it could have been, Chief; we&rsquo;ve been
talking that over, and I&rsquo;m prepared to say that it
could have been,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the shoulders? Though broad, like a
man&rsquo;s, might not a woman&rsquo;s figure, say, wrapped
in furs, give a similar effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An icy chill went through me, but I answered,
&ldquo;It might; the outlines were very indistinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are carefully investigating the movements
of Miss Raynor,&rdquo; he went on, steadily, &ldquo;and we
find she told a deliberate untruth about where she
spent yesterday afternoon. She said she was at
the house of a friend on Park Avenue. We learned
the name of the young lady and she says Miss
Raynor was not there at all yesterday. Also, we
find that Miss Raynor was in this office <i>after</i> the
calls of the old people we know about, and not
<i>before</i> them, as Miss Raynor herself testified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, please. This is positively
proved by the fact that a check drawn to Miss
Raynor by Mr. Gately follows immediately <i>after</i>
the two checks drawn to Mr. Smith and Mrs.
Driggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proving?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Miss Raynor is the last one known to be
in this room before the shooting occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Norah, &ldquo;for shame! To suspect
that lovely girl! Why, she wouldn&rsquo;t harm a fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an oft proven fact that the mildest, gentlest
woman, if sufficiently provoked to it, or if
given a sudden opportunity, will in a moment of
passion do what no one would dream she could do!
Miss Raynor was very angry with her uncle,&mdash;Jenny
admitted that, after much delay. Mr.
Gately had a revolver, usually in his desk drawer,
but <i>not</i> there now. And,&rdquo;&mdash;an impressive pause
preceded the next argument, &ldquo;Mr. Amory Manning
is not to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you deduce from that?&rdquo; I asked,
amazedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he has purposely disappeared, lest he be
brought as a witness against Miss Raynor. He
could best help her cause, by being out of town and
impossible to locate. So, he went off, and she pretended
she did not know it. Of course, she did,&mdash;they
connived at it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you are romancing. You are
assuming conditions that are untrue!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it were so,&rdquo; and the Chief exhibited a
very human aspect for the moment; &ldquo;but I have
no choice in the matter. I am driven by an inexorable
army of facts that cannot be beaten back.
What else can you think of that would account for
Mr. Manning&rsquo;s sudden disappearance? Attacked?
Nonsense! Not in the storm of last evening. Abducted?
Why? He is an inoffensive citizen, not
a millionaire or man of influence. You said you
saw him last night, Mr. Brice. Where, exactly, was
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told of my trip down in the Third Avenue car,
and of my getting off at Twenty-second Street,
meaning to speak to Mr. Manning. Then I told
of his sudden, almost mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mysterious at all,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;He
gave you the slip purposely. He went away at once,
and has hidden himself carefully. But we will find
him. It&rsquo;s not easy for a man to hide from the
police in this day and generation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Raynor!&rdquo; I said, still incredulous.
&ldquo;Why? What motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because her uncle wouldn&rsquo;t let her marry
Amory Manning. When she said she went to her
friend, Miss Clark&rsquo;s house, she really went to the
home of a Mrs. Russell, the sister of Manning.
She was to meet Manning there. I have all this
straight from Mrs. Russell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it was Miss Raynor&rsquo;s shadow
I saw on the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it might have been a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then look for another woman! It
was never Miss Raynor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your indignation, Mr. Brice, is both natural
and admirable, but it is based on your disinclination
to think ill of Miss Raynor. The police are
not allowed the luxury of such sentiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;how did she&mdash;how did Miss Raynor
get out of the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not entirely credit Jenny&rsquo;s story of the
man with a revolver running downstairs. And we
do think that the person who did the shooting may
have gone down in the private elevator with the
victim. It would be easy to gain the street unnoticed,
and it presupposes someone acquainted with
the working of the automatic elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Raynor said she had never seen it,&rdquo;
I cried, triumphantly. &ldquo;She said she had only
heard her uncle speak of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she <i>said</i> so,&rdquo; returned the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />Hudson&rsquo;s Errand</h2>
<p>For a day or two I moped around, decidedly
out of sorts. I didn&rsquo;t feel sufficiently acquainted
with Miss Raynor to call on her,&mdash;though
she had once asked me to do so,&mdash;but I
greatly longed to find out if the police had yet acquainted
her with their suspicions. I thought perhaps
they were waiting for further proofs, or it
might be, waiting until after the funeral of Mr.
Gately. There had been, so far, nothing in the
papers implicating Olive, and I hoped against hope
there would not be. But I felt sure she was being
closely watched, and I didn&rsquo;t know what new evidence
might be cooking up against her.</p>
<p>The funeral of the great capitalist was on Saturday
evening.</p>
<p>I attended, and this being my first visit to the
house, I was all unprepared for the wealth of art
treasures it held.</p>
<p>I sat in the great salon, lost in admiration of the
pictures and bronzes, as well as the beautiful architecture
and mural decorations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>A throng of people attended the services and the
oppressive fragrance of massed flowers and the
continuous click of folding-chairs, combined with
the whispers and subdued rustling of the audience,
produced that unmistakable funeral atmosphere so
trying to sensitive nerves.</p>
<p>Then, a single clear, sweet soprano voice, raised
in a solemn anthem, broke the tension, and soon the
brief obsequies were over, and I found myself moving
along with the crush of people slowly surging
toward the door.</p>
<p>I walked home, the clear, frosty air feeling grateful
after the crowded rooms.</p>
<p>And I wondered. Wondered what would be the
next scene in the awful drama. Would they accuse
Miss Raynor,&mdash;lovely Olive Raynor, of the crime?
How could they? That delicate, high-bred girl!</p>
<p>And yet, she was independent of thought and
fearless of action.</p>
<p>Though I knew her but slightly, I had heard more
or less about her, and I had learned she was by
no means of a yielding or easily swayed disposition.
She deeply resented her guardian&rsquo;s tyrannical treatment
of her and had not infrequently told him so.
While they were not outwardly at odds, they were
uncongenial natures, and of widely divergent
tastes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Olive, as is natural for a young girl, wanted
guests and gayety. Mr. Gately, a thoroughly selfish
man, preferred quiet and freedom from company.
Her insistence met with refusal and the results were
often distressing to both of them. In fact, Miss
Raynor had threatened to leave her guardian&rsquo;s
home and live by herself, but this by no means
suited his convenience. The comfort of his home
and the proper administration of his household
depended largely on Olive&rsquo;s capable and efficient
management, and without her presence and care he
would miss many pleasant details of his daily existence.
He rarely allowed her to go away on a
visit, and almost never permitted her to have a
friend to stay with her.</p>
<p>I learned of these intimate matters from Norah,&mdash;who,
in turn, had them from Jenny.</p>
<p>Jenny had not been with Mr. Gately long, but she
had managed to pick up bits of information regarding
his home life with surprising quickness, and
when quizzed by the police had told all she knew,&mdash;and,
I suspected,&mdash;<i>more</i> than she knew,&mdash;about
Miss Raynor.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t suppose the police went so far as
to assume that Olive Raynor had killed Mr. Gately
because he would not indulge her wishes, but they
seemed to think they really had grounds for suspecting.</p>
<p>I was in despair. On Sunday, I could think of
nothing but the matter and I wondered if it would
be too presumptuous of me to offer Miss Raynor
my help or advice. Doubtless she had hordes of
advisers, but she might need such a legal friend as
I could be to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>On the impulse, I telephoned and asked if she
cared to see me. To my delighted surprise she
welcomed the suggestion and begged me to call that
afternoon, as she had real need of legal advice.</p>
<p>And so four o&rsquo;clock found me again at the house
of the late president of the Trust Company.</p>
<p>This time I was shown to a small reception room,
where Olive soon appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she said after a few
moments&rsquo; conversation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Pond,&mdash;he&rsquo;s
Uncle&rsquo;s lawyer,&mdash;I just can&rsquo;t bear the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For any definite reason, Miss Raynor?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&mdash;well, that is&mdash;oh, he&rsquo;s a horrid old
thing, and he wants to marry me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure you want to confide these
personal matters to me?&rdquo; I felt I ought to say
this, for the girl was nervously excited, and I was
by no means sure she would not later regret her
outspokenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I want a lawyer, Mr. Brice, and I
will not have Mr. Pond. So I ask you here and
now to take my affairs in charge, look after my
financial matters, and advise me in many ways
when I need your help. You may suppose I have
many friends,&rdquo;&mdash;the big brown eyes were pathetically
imploring, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t. Uncle Amos,&mdash;of
course, you know he was not my uncle, but I called
him that,&mdash;would not allow me to make many
friends and his own acquaintances are all elderly
people and he hadn&rsquo;t very many of those. My
money is in my own right. Mr. Gately was punctilious
in his care of my accounts,&mdash;and I want it
all taken out of the hands of Mr. Pond and transferred
to your care. This can be done, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Olive looked imperious and seemed to think the
matter all settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless it can be arranged, Miss Raynor; I
will consider it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t consider,&mdash;just say yes! If you don&rsquo;t I
must hunt up another lawyer, and&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather have
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t proof against her pretty, dictatorial
ways, and I agreed to take the steps she desired.</p>
<p>She went on to tell me how she was placed:</p>
<p>Not only in possession of a considerable fortune
of her own, Amos Gately&rsquo;s will left her a goodly
additional sum, and also the house in which they
had lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; Olive said, &ldquo;I shall continue to
live here,&mdash;for the present. I have Mrs. Vail now
with me,&mdash;as a duenna, for propriety&rsquo;s sake. She
is a dear old lady, and is of a pliable, manageable
sort. I chose her for that reason, largely. Also,
she is pleasant and cheerful, and I like to have her
about. I was fond of Uncle Amos, Mr. Brice, but
we had many dissensions. If he had allowed me
a little more freedom, I could have got along with
him beautifully,&mdash;but he treated me as a child.
You see, he took me to live with him when I <i>was</i>
a child, and he never realized that I had grown up
and had an individuality and a will of my own. I
am twenty-two years old, and he acted as if I were
twelve!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now, absolutely your own mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange? And it is <i>all</i> so
strange! This house, without him, is like a different
house. And the dreadfulness of his death!
Sometimes I think I can&rsquo;t stay here,&mdash;I must get
into other surroundings. But the thought of moving
out of here is too much for me, at present,
anyway. Oh, I don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> to do! I can&rsquo;t
realize that he is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive did not cry. She sat, dry-eyed and tearless,
looking so pathetically lonely and so unable
to cope with her new responsibilities, that I gladly
promised her all possible assistance that I could give,
both in legal matters and in any personal or
friendly ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me helpless,&rdquo; she said, reading my
thoughts; &ldquo;I shall rise to the situation, I shall
adapt myself to my changed circumstances, but it
will take a little time, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t attempt to
do too much at first. Take plenty of time to rest
and to let yourself react from the shock and the
awful scenes you have been through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>It was clear to me that the girl had no thought
that she was suspected, or that the police were
watching her. I wondered whether it would be
kinder to give her a hint of this or to leave her in
ignorance, when just then a servant entered, saying
Mr. Hudson wished an interview with Miss
Raynor.</p>
<p>Hudson! Foxy Jim Hudson! Of course, this
could mean but one thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me stay!&rdquo; I said, impulsively, and, &ldquo;Oh,
do!&rdquo; she returned, and in another minute Hudson
came in.</p>
<p>There was something about the man&rsquo;s manner
that I couldn&rsquo;t help liking and if Olive had to be
questioned I felt sure he would do it as gently as
anybody could.</p>
<p>Though uncultured, his voice was kindly, and as
he put some preliminary questions Olive answered
straightforwardly and without objection.</p>
<p>But when he asked her where she had been on
the afternoon of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s death, she looked at
him haughtily, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told all that to the man who questioned me
downtown,&mdash;that Mr. Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him the truth, Miss Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the one word, Olive put a world of scornful
pride, but I could note also a look of fear in her
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let me give you a bit of friendly advice,&rdquo;
Hudson said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a very young lady, and you
prob&rsquo;ly think you can tell a little white falsehood
and get away with it, but you can&rsquo;t do it to the
police. You see, miss, we know where you were
on Wednesday afternoon, and you may as well be
frank about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, where was I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the house of Mrs. Russell,&mdash;the sister of
Mr. Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive looked at him in amazement. Then her
manner changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I may as well own
up. I <i>was</i> at Mrs. Russell&rsquo;s. What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that if you prevaricated in one instance,
Miss Raynor, you may have done so in others.
Will you tell me why you said you were at the
house of your friend, Miss Clark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. My guardian was unwilling
to have me go to Mrs. Russell&rsquo;s house, because of
a personal matter. Therefore, when I wished to
go there I sometimes told him that I was going to
Miss Clark&rsquo;s. This small falsehood I considered
justifiable, because Mr. Gately had no right to say
where I should go and where not! If I was untruthful
it was because his unjust rules and regulations
made me so! I am not a story-teller, ordinarily.
If I was forced to be one, in order to enjoy
some simple pleasures or diversions, it is no one&rsquo;s
business but my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Hudson,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;why constitute
yourself Miss Raynor&rsquo;s Sunday-School
teacher?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I am to do so,&rdquo; and the good-natured
face showed real regret; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve orders. Now,
Miss Raynor, I must put you a few straight questions.
Where&rsquo;s Mr. Amory Manning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I only wish I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, that won&rsquo;t do! I guess you can
think up some hint of his whereabouts for me. You
can&rsquo;t deceive us, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I want to!&rdquo; Olive&rsquo;s eyes blazed.
&ldquo;Because I found it necessary to evade my guardian&rsquo;s
espionage now and then you needn&rsquo;t think I
am unable to tell the truth! I have no idea where
Mr. Manning is, and I am exceedingly anxious lest
some harm has befallen him. If you can find him
you will be doing me a great favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you engaged to him, Miss Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not, though I do not concede your
right to ask that question. Mr. Manning and I
are good friends, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gately did not approve of his attentions
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not, and that was why I refrained from
telling of occasions when I saw or might see Mr.
Manning at his sister&rsquo;s house. If that is of interest
to you, I&rsquo;ve no objections to your knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you fire a pistol, Miss Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived it was Hudson&rsquo;s method to take her
by surprise, and so, perhaps, learn something from
an answer given off her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, promptly, &ldquo;I am a good shot;
why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Her wondering eyes were fearless, now, and to
me it seemed a proof of her entire innocence that
she showed no embarrassment at this inquiry.</p>
<p>But Hudson evidently thought differently. He
looked accusingly at her, and continued, &ldquo;Do you
own a pistol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mr. Gately gave me one a few years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at our country-place, on Long Island.
I am afraid of burglars there, but not nearly so
much so in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Now, Miss Raynor, you are the last one
known to have seen Amos Gately alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Brice saw the shooting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in shadow. I mean you are the last one
known to have talked with him in his office. Was
your interview&mdash;er,&mdash;amicable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely so. I went there for some money, as
I occasionally did. My guardian gave me a check
and I cashed it at the Trust Company Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that; and that the check was
given to you, and was later cashed, all at about the
time Mr. Gately was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier Mr. Hudson. I was in the bank about
half-past two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Raynor. We have the teller&rsquo;s statement
that you were there about three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is mistaken,&rdquo; Olive&rsquo;s voice was confident,
and had in it a ring of indignation, &ldquo;by three
o&rsquo;clock, or very little after, I was at Mrs. Russell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mr. Manning there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; he expected to come later, after he had
attended to some business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but it must have been somewhere
in the vicinity of the Puritan Building, for
he was near there when I arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, perhaps half-past three
or a little later. I had been at Mrs. Russell&rsquo;s but
a few moments when Mr. Talcott telephoned me
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he know you were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called up Miss Clark first, and she told
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends, then, aided and abetted you in
deceiving your guardian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I resent the way you put that, Mr. Hudson,&rdquo;
Olive looked at him haughtily, &ldquo;but I answer, yes.
My friends agreed with me that Mr. Gately was
unreasonable in his commands and that I was not
bound to obey them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are now freed from his injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a brutal speech and unworthy of any
man! My freedom is too dearly purchased at such
a fearful price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i> you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you implying, Mr. Hudson? Speak
out! Do you think I killed my guardian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people that do think that, Miss
Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave this house!&rdquo; cried Olive, rising. &ldquo;Such
words can not be spoken here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, miss, dramatics won&rsquo;t get you anywheres!
There is evidence against you, or so the
police think, and it&rsquo;s up to me to tell you that we
must ask you not to go out of town without acquainting
us of the fact. We do not accuse you,
but we do want you where we can communicate
with you at will. I am going now Miss Raynor.
I came only to make sure on a few points,&mdash;which
I have done,&mdash;and to tell you to remain within call.
Indeed, I may as well tell you that any attempt to
get away will be frustrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I am under surveillance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive looked at him as one might regard a worm
of the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said, quietly but forcefully. &ldquo;I shall
not leave town, I shall probably not leave this
house. Your suspicion is beneath contempt. However,
it has taught me one thing,&mdash;I shall engage
someone else&mdash;someone quite outside the stupid
police, to discover the murderer of my uncle! And
also to trace my friend, Mr. Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hudson smiled. He looked at Olive almost
tolerantly, as if she were a wilful child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Miss Raynor. I&rsquo;ll take your word
as to your staying here, and I rather guess the
police force will yet round up the murderer and will
also discover the hiding-place of Amory Manning.
Good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hudson went away, and Olive turned to me in
a passion of rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What insolence!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Are such
things permitted? To come here and practically
accuse me of my uncle&rsquo;s murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t your uncle, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I loved him as I would
a relative. His sternness and his unreasonable
commands were distasteful to me, but that didn&rsquo;t
alter my real love and affection for the man. He
has been everything to me for the greater part of
my life. He has been kindness itself in most matters.
He indulged me in all possible ways as to
creature comforts and luxuries. He never criticized
the ways in which I spent my money, or in
which I entertained myself, save in the matter of
having guests or making visits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And allowing admirers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some men he approved of,&mdash;you
may as well know, Mr. Brice, my guardian wished
me to marry his friend and lawyer, Mr. Pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when that gentleman is so greatly your
senior?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merely because Uncle was so fond of him.
And, too, Uncle never seemed to realize that I was
of a different generation from himself. He couldn&rsquo;t
understand,&mdash;he really couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;why I wanted
young company and gay parties. <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t, and
he really assumed that <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t. I think he never
realized how greatly he was depriving me when he
forbade me society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it really amount to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically. Or, if I succeeded in persuading
him to let me have a house guest or a small party,
he made things so unpleasant that I was glad when
they were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unpleasant, how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fussing around, as if his comfort were interfered
with,&mdash;as if he were terribly incommoded
by their presence, and by demanding my time and
attention for himself, instead of allowing me to
entertain my guests properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless so you wouldn&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But all that was uncomfortable
for me,&mdash;almost unbearable,&mdash;yet one doesn&rsquo;t kill
one&rsquo;s people for such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me this simple statement of Olive Raynor&rsquo;s
was more convincing than a storm of denial. She
had stormed, with indignation, at the hint of suspicion,
but her quiet, dignified refutation went far
to assure me of her entire innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, one doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;and now to
find out who did do it. Have you any suspicion,&mdash;Miss
Raynor, even the slightest?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; except that it seems to me it must have
been some man who knew Uncle in a business way.
Though a generous and charitable man, Amos
Gately was scrupulously just, and if he had enemies,
they were men whom he had discovered in
some wrong-doing and he had exposed or punished
them. No man had a cause for righteous enmity
against him,&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />The Man Who Fell Through the Earth</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And it is for me,&rdquo; Olive went on, with a
solemn look in her brown eyes, &ldquo;to avenge
the death of my guardian. I am not worried
about this surveillance, or whatever they call it, of
myself,&mdash;it is too absurd to take very seriously.
Of course, I shall not leave the city, and I will
answer any questions the police may put to me.
For, you see, Mr. Brice, the only reason I had for
telling falsehoods is a reason no longer. I did
resort to &lsquo;white lies&rsquo; because Uncle Amos was so
unreasonably strict with me, but I&rsquo;ve no further
need for that sort of thing, and I assure you you
will find me absolutely truthful from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sad little smile accompanied the words, and
an earnest expression on the delicate, high-bred face
gave me implicit confidence in her sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I hastened to advise her, &ldquo;do not antagonize
the police. If they have you under their
eye, rest assured they think there is some reason
to watch you. Be friendly, or, at least patient with
them, and they will all the sooner be aware of their
mistake. Moreover, you want their help in running
down the real murderer of your guardian. It
is a mysterious affair, Miss Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is, Mr. Brice, and it may be that in
penetrating the mystery we may unearth something&mdash;you
know,&mdash;something detrimental to Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any such fear&mdash;definitely, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitely, no. If I had I should tell you.
But in a vague, apprehensive way, I feel there must
be something in his life that brought this about,
and that I as yet know nothing of. But you think,
don&rsquo;t you, that we must go ahead and learn all we
can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not afraid, then, of investigation, for
yourself&mdash;or, for anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put this query after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, yet
I had to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; her voice rang out clearly. &ldquo;I know
what you mean, you are thinking of Mr. Manning.
And there is another task for you. We must find
Amory Manning. That man never went away,
voluntarily, without sending me some word. He
said he would come up here that night,&mdash;the night
of Uncle&rsquo;s death. He didn&rsquo;t come, nor did he communicate
with me in any way. That means he was
unable to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could have happened that would make
it impossible for him to send you some word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think, I&rsquo;m sure. But he
was attacked or overcome by someone who wanted
him put out of the way. Mr. Manning had enemies,&mdash;that
much I may tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know more? That you can <i>not</i> tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is, I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> anything,&mdash;but I
have some foreboding,&mdash;oh, nothing definite, Mr.
Brice, but I can&rsquo;t help fearing we shall never see
Amory Manning alive again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to force your confidence, but can&rsquo;t
you tell me a few more facts? Why has he enemies?
Are they political?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in a way. Don&rsquo;t ask me now anyway.
Let us try to find Amory and if we fail, I may
decide it my duty to tell you what I now withhold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this I was forced to be content. For
Olive Raynor did not talk like a young, inexperienced
girl, as I had thought her; she gave me now
the impression of a young woman involved in
weighty matters, and the trusted holder of important
secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;suppose we try
first to find Mr. Manning,&mdash;or to learn what became
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed; &ldquo;but how shall we set about
it? I&rsquo;ve already telephoned to several of his friends,
whom I know, and none of them has seen him
since that day,&mdash;the day of Uncle&rsquo;s death. Thank
Heaven nobody is foolish enough to blame that on
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t very well, as he was with you
when the discovery was made.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. And for the police to say he ran
away to hide to protect me from suspicion is just
about the most absurd theory possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too. Now, to get down to dates.
Have you heard anything of Mr. Manning later
than the time when I saw him get off the Third
Avenue car on his way home that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. And we know he never reached
his home. His rooms are in a house on Gramercy
Park&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he got off at Twenty-second
Street&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. He left you there, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both got off the car there. My own rooms
are in the same locality. But the snow squall was
a whirlwind at the corner, and my glasses were so
covered with flakes that I couldn&rsquo;t see a thing for a
moment, and when I could, Manning had got out
of sight. I didn&rsquo;t know then in just what direction
he lived, so I looked all four ways but I didn&rsquo;t see
him. However, in the black squall, one couldn&rsquo;t
see half a dozen steps anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he started toward his home,&mdash;perhaps,
he almost reached it,&mdash;when whoever was
lying in wait for him attacked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure he was attacked? He
may have had an errand in some other direction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sort of see the thing as a picture. And as he
got out at that corner I naturally see him going
straight home. It is not likely that he would be going
on some other errand, and yet get off at that
corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, as he never did go home,&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
been there yet,&mdash;what theory is there except that he
was prevented from going there? He may have
been kidnaped,&mdash;don&rsquo;t smile, it is among the possibilities,&mdash;or,
he may have met with a serious
accident,&mdash;slipped and broken his leg or something
of that sort. But in such a case, he would have
been taken to a hospital, and I should have heard
of it. No, Mr. Brice, he was carried off by some
powerful enemy. I say powerful, meaning rather,
clever or diplomatic, for as I see it, trickery would
have been used, not force, to abduct Amory Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why abduct him?&rdquo; I cried in amazement
&ldquo;What is he? Why is he a menace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, Mr. Brice, unless it becomes
gravely necessary. But it has to do with&mdash;with men
higher up,&mdash;and it has nothing to do with my
guardian&rsquo;s death,&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Raynor; I trust you, of course,
that goes without saying, but I also trust your
judgment in reserving your full confidence in this
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may. I assure you I will tell you all, if it
becomes imperative that I do so. Meantime, let us
try to find some trace of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tried the hospitals?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have telephoned to some of them, and I
asked our family doctor to inquire of others. He
did so, but with only negative results. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s time to call in a detective,&rdquo; I said,
positively. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mean a mere police detective,
but a special investigator. Have you any objection
to such a course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not if we get a good one. I don&rsquo;t know
much about such things, but don&rsquo;t some of those
all-wise detectives have more theories and deductions
than results?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have put your finger on a vital flaw in the
usual Smarty-Cat detective,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;But I
know of a splendid man. He is eccentric, I admit,
but beyond that he has none of the earmarks of the
Transcendental Detective of the story-books. He is
intelligent rather than cocksure and efficient rather
than spectacular. He <i>is</i> expensive, but no more so
than his success warrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds well. But first, Mr. Brice, can&rsquo;t
we do a little investigating by ourselves? I had
hoped so. To engage a detective is to make the
whole affair so public, and I shrink from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily, Miss Raynor. If the man I
speak of should take the case, he would make no
fuss or stir about it. And if you say so, he can
also try to find the man who killed Amos Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is what I want! Yes, let us retain&mdash;or
whatever the procedure is, your detective. What
is his name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, but it is Penny Wise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? How ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but true. Pennington Wise is on his
visiting cards, but no human nature could refrain
from the inevitable nickname.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to change that name! It&rsquo;s enough to
belittle any good work he might do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he doesn&rsquo;t think so. In fact, he has become
so used to having people joke about it that he
only smiles perfunctorily and goes on about his
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ask him to help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, and if not too busy on some
other matter he will doubtless begin at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so young and inexperienced,&rdquo; Olive shuddered,
&ldquo;to be deciding these big things. It seems
as if someone older and wiser ought to direct me.
Oh, I know I have your help and counsel, but I
wish I had some relative or near friend on whose
judgment I could rely. I am singularly alone in the
world, Mr. Brice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have Mrs. Vail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My companion? She is delightful as a chaperon
and promises to be most pleasant and congenial in
my home life, but she is not capable of giving me
any advice of value in these important affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed alone, Miss Raynor, but you
are amazingly capable for a young woman and you
continually surprise me by your grasp of the situation
and your ability to rise to its demands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had Amory Manning to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor child, I knew that was at the bottom of her
loneliness, and though I didn&rsquo;t presume to sympathize,
I felt privileged to assure her of my personal
help as well as my interested performance of my
legal duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;there
is one thing I want you to do for me. I want you
to go to the morgue. I can&rsquo;t bring myself to do
that, nor do I want to ask anyone else I know
to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I replied, instinctively treating the
matter casually, for I saw she was deeply moved.
&ldquo;It will be merely a form, but it is better to feel
we have made every possible inquiry and left no
stone unturned. I will go there at once,&mdash;now, if
you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed gratified at my prompt compliance,
and urged my going immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back this evening and report,&rdquo; she said,
and then, with one of those sudden changes of demeanor
which I was beginning to learn were characteristic
of her, she bade me good afternoon with a
quick, curt manner, and practically dismissed me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>I started on my grewsome errand with enough
food for thought to set my brain in a whirl. I was
deeply in the matter now, and quite satisfied that
it should be so. I was the lawyer and adviser of
Miss Raynor, and I determined to do my best to
deserve and justify her choice. Hitherto obscure,
I should now be looked up to by members of my
profession with envy&mdash;and, doubtless, with criticism.
The latter, I meant to take good care, should
be favorable.</p>
<p>As I looked at it I had three distinct missions.
First, to arrange and attend to all of Miss Raynor&rsquo;s
financial matters. Second, to assist her to track
down the murderer of Amos Gately. Third, to
help her to find, or to learn the fate of Amory
Manning.</p>
<p>The first was my only personal charge. The
other two must be accomplished by Wise, and for
my part I felt sure he would succeed.</p>
<p>My visit to the morgue, as I had surmised,
brought no result. The poor unfortunates whose
mortal remains had been brought there during or
since Wednesday, the day of Manning&rsquo;s disappearance,
could by no stretch of the imagination be
thought to look like Amory Manning.</p>
<p>Though I had never seen him until that day, I
had a vivid picture of the man, large-framed,
well set up, and with a general air of forcefulness
and power. I had watched his face, as we stood
in the crowded street-car, too far apart for conversation,
yet in full view of each other.</p>
<p>His face was strong and scholarly, the latter effect
enhanced by his huge, shell-rimmed glasses, and he
had thick, rather coarse dark hair. Also a dark
Vandyke beard and small mustache, both carefully
trimmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said to the morgue-keeper, &ldquo;the man
I&rsquo;m looking for isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went on to tell him of Manning, in case he knew
anything to tell me. But he only said, briefly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the first, sir. The police have
looked here for Mr. Manning and some others have
done so beside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the police were ahead of me! Well, that only
made it the more certain that what we sought was
not here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was another chap, but he wasn&rsquo;t Mr.
Manning either,&rdquo; vouchsafed my informant.
&ldquo;Howsomever, the police went to see him. Wanta
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that same afternoon, there was a corpse
picked outa the East River, froze stiff. Leastways,
we thought he was a corpse, but blamed if the
chap didn&rsquo;t come to life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t greatly interested, for if the corpse was
taken from the river that afternoon, it couldn&rsquo;t have
been Manning. But the morgue-keeper went on:
&ldquo;You might take a look, sir, to see if you know
him. For the poor fellow&rsquo;s lost his mind,&mdash;no, not
that,&mdash;but he&rsquo;s lost his memory, and he dunno who
he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amnesia?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it, and the other thing,
too. Aspasia,&mdash;or whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aphasia,&rdquo; I corrected him, without smiling, for
how should he know anything about what was a
mystery to most skilled physicians. &ldquo;Where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They carted him over to Bellevue soon&rsquo;s they
seen he was alive. It was a touch job to <i>keep</i> him
alive, I heard, and his memory is completely busted.
It would be a godsend to him if you could identify
him. I ask everybody to take a look on the chance.
Somehow, I&rsquo;m sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t especially interested, but being thus appealed
to in the interests of humanity, I went over
to the hospital, and had no difficulty in gaining a
sight of the patient in question. Indeed, the doctors
were most anxious for visitors to see him, hoping
that someone might identify the man.</p>
<p>My first glance convinced me it was not Amory
Manning, though I had not thought that it was.</p>
<p>This man had thin, light hair and vacant-looking,
weak eyes. He was smooth-shaven and his voice
was peculiar,&mdash;a voice sufficient to identify anyone,
I felt sure, but it was not a voice I had heard before.</p>
<p>No; I didn&rsquo;t know him, and a careful scrutiny
made me positive I did not.</p>
<p>But it was a sorry case. Apparently the man was
of good education and accustomed to cultured surroundings.
Moreover, he had a sense of humor
which had not deserted him, along with his memory.</p>
<p>I sat by his bedside, and I remained rather longer
than I had intended, for I became interested in his
story, and the time slipped by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, fixing me with his queer-looking
eyes, &ldquo;I fell through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I fell through the earth, and it was a
long, long fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, eight thousand miles, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and he was almost pettish, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
fall through the middle of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and I paused for further enlightenment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this way. I remember it perfectly,
you know. I was somewhere,&mdash;somewhere up
North&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He shook his
head uncertainly. &ldquo;But I know it was up North
where it&rsquo;s always cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the man had been an Arctic explorer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iceland?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Greenland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; and he looked uninterested. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
here he brightened a little, &ldquo;anyway, I fell through
the earth. I fell in <i>there</i>, wherever it was, and came
on down, down through the earth till I came out at
the other end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, you fell through a section or segment
of the globe? As if, say, you fell in at London and
came out at the Cape of Good Hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea! Only I fell <i>out</i> here in New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you fell in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t remember, only it was &rsquo;way
up North,&mdash;somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had a map, now, and looked at all the
Northern countries, it might recall itself to you,&mdash;the
place where you entered,&mdash;where you began your
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, but the nurse brought me an atlas
and I couldn&rsquo;t find the place. I wish I had a
globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor chap. I wondered what had given him this
strange hallucination. But as he talked on, I became
interested in his own personality.</p>
<p>He was as sane as I was in all respects, save his
insistence that he had fallen through the earth.</p>
<p>As a child, an ambition of mine had been to dig
down to China, and many times I had started the
task. Perhaps his childhood had known a similar
ambition, and now, his memory gone, his distorted
mind harked back to that idea. I changed the subject,
and found him remarkably well informed,
fairly well educated, and of a curiously analytical
temperament, but of his identity or his personality
he had no knowledge.</p>
<p>He appreciated this, and it made the thing more
pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will come back to me,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully.
&ldquo;The doctors have explained all about this aphasic-amnesia,
and though mine is the worst case they
have ever seen, it will go away some time, and I&rsquo;ll
recover my memory and know who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can reason and understand everything said
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;m my own man in every respect
except in a knowledge of who or what I was before
that journey through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I tried plain common sense, &ldquo;then, if
you can reason, you must know that you didn&rsquo;t fall
through the earth. It would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. My reason tells me it&rsquo;s impossible.
But all I know about it is, that I did do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a long hole,&mdash;miles long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who bored the hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was there all the time. I suppose Nature
made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a sort of rock fissure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; more like a mine,&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, old chap! You were a miner, and
there was a cave-in, and it spoiled your thinker&mdash;temporarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a mine doesn&rsquo;t have an exit at the bottom
of it. I tell you I was far away from where I
fell in, and I came miles straight down through the
solid earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you see plainly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it was dark,&mdash;how could it be otherwise,
inside the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>It was hopeless to dissuade him. We talked for
some time, and outside his hallucination he was keen
and quick-witted. But whatever gave him his idea
of his strange adventure he thoroughly believed in
it and nothing would shake that belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do when you get out of
here?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But I can&rsquo;t help feeling
that the world owes me a living&mdash;especially after
I&rsquo;ve fallen through it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed, for his humor was infectious, and I
felt pretty sure he would make good somehow.
He was about thirty, I judged, and though not
a brawny man, he seemed possessed of a wiry
strength.</p>
<p>The doctors, he told me, assured him of speedily
returning health but would give no definite promise
regarding the return of his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get along without
it, and start out fresh. Why, I haven&rsquo;t even a
name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can acquire one at small expense,&rdquo; I advised
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve part of it now. I shall take Rivers
as a surname, because they pulled me out of the
East River, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were you dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Adam&rsquo;s costume, I&rsquo;m told. I regret the loss
of a full suit of apparel, more especially as it might
have proved my identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you were entirely divested of clothing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Except for a few rags of underwear, entirely
worthless as clews to what was doubtless an illustrious
personality! However, I&rsquo;m lucky to have
breath left in my body, and when I get back my
memory, I&rsquo;ll prove that I really did fall through the
earth, and I&rsquo;ll find out where I fell in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope you will, old chap,&rdquo; and I shook
hands as I rose to go. &ldquo;As the play says, &lsquo;You
interest me strangely!&rsquo; May I come to see you
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would, Mr. Brice, and by that time I
shall have chosen me a first name.&rdquo;</p>

<br />The Man in Boston</h2>
<p>I could not suppress a feeling of elation as I
once again rang at the door of Olive Raynor&rsquo;s
home that evening. I almost began to
feel a proprietary interest in the mansion, as I now
was practically the legal adviser of its new mistress.
And to be received as a privileged caller, even a
welcome one, was a source of gratification to my
pride and self-respect.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail was present at our interview this time,
and my first sight of her gave me a very favorable
impression. A distinguished-looking lady, slightly
past middle age, she was aristocratic of bearing and
kindly pleasant of manner. Perhaps a trifle of condescension
mingled with her courteous reception of
me, but I put that down to her recent acquirement
of a position of importance. No such trait was
visible in Miss Raynor&rsquo;s simple and sincere greeting,
and as Olive eagerly inquired as to the result
of my afternoon&rsquo;s quest, I told her my story at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>She was greatly relieved that no trace of Amory
Manning had been found on the morgue records
and though she was duly sympathetic when I told
her of the strange case of the man who fell through
the earth, it only momentarily claimed her preoccupied
attention.</p>
<p>She first satisfied herself that by no chance could
this man be Manning, and then turned her thoughts
back to her all-engrossing theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for him,&rdquo; she said, as I described
his cheerful disposition and rather winning personality,
&ldquo;and if I can do anything to help him, I
will do it. Does he want a position of some sort
when he gets well enough to take one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he will,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an alive
sort of chap, and of course he&rsquo;ll earn his living one
way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he may soon recover his memory,&rdquo; began
Mrs. Vail. &ldquo;I knew a man once who had amnesia
and aphasia both, and it was six months before he
got over it. But when his memory came back, it
came all at once, like a flash, and then he was all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the doctors want to find
someone who knows the man. It ought not to be
difficult to find his friends, or someone who can
identify him. Why, that peculiar voice ought to
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imitate it,&rdquo; directed Mrs. Vail, and to the best
of my ability I talked in the monotonous tones of
the amnesic victim.</p>
<p>Olive laughed. &ldquo;I never heard anybody talk like
that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely uninflected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what it was. He had no inflections
or shadings in his tones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A voice is so individual,&rdquo; pursued Olive.
&ldquo;Amory Manning&rsquo;s voice is full and musical; I&rsquo;ve
often told him he conveys as much meaning by his
tones as by his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew a man once,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Vail, &ldquo;who
could recite the alphabet so dramatically that he
made his audience laugh or cry or shudder, just by
his tones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard that done on the vaudeville
stage,&rdquo; said Olive. &ldquo;Now Mr. Brice, what shall be
our next step? I don&rsquo;t mind confessing I&rsquo;m relieved
that your errand of today is over with. Our
doctor told me there was no chance of Mr. Manning
having been killed or injured, without our receiving
notification of the fact, somehow. But I&rsquo;ve been
nervously troubled about it, and nights I&rsquo;ve dreamed
of seeing him somewhere,&mdash;alone and helpless,&mdash;and
unable to let me know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vail; &ldquo;I knew a man
once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Olive cut short the tale of this acquaintance
of her friend and kept to the business in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything better to do,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;than to advertise. But why are not other people
doing this? Who are Mr. Manning&rsquo;s friends?
Who are his business people? Why are they
silent?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that they are,&rdquo; Olive returned;
&ldquo;but to tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t know much about
Mr. Manning&rsquo;s affairs, in a business way. I know
he is a civil engineer, but that&rsquo;s about all. A consulting
engineer he is, too. As to his people, I
know only his sister, and she doesn&rsquo;t know what to
do either. I&rsquo;ve seen Mrs. Russell twice since, and
we can only sympathize with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Russell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband? He&rsquo;s in France, and she&rsquo;s alone
with her two little girls. She and Amory are devoted
to each other, and he was of such help and
comfort to her in her husband&rsquo;s absence. Now, she
doesn&rsquo;t know which way to turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must look these things up,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I must
talk with Mr. Manning&rsquo;s business associates,&mdash;doubtless
Mrs. Russell can tell me of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. You go to see her, and
she&rsquo;ll be only too glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to a detective? Shall I get in touch
with Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. It does seem so queer for me
to decide these things! I can&rsquo;t get used to the fact
that I&rsquo;m my own guardian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re of age, Olive,&rdquo; and Mrs. Vail smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and I&rsquo;ve had entire control of my
money for some time. But Uncle always decided
all matters of importance,&mdash;though, goodness knows,
there never were any such to decide as those that
beset us now! Think of my engaging a detective!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Wise is so interesting and so adaptable,
you&rsquo;ll really like him. I&rsquo;ll ask him to call here with
me some afternoon or evening and you can get acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet him,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Vail; &ldquo;I
knew a man once who wanted to be a detective,
but he died. I&rsquo;ve never seen a real
detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pennington Wise is a real one, all right,&rdquo; I
declared. &ldquo;Of course, Miss Raynor, I shall tell
the police that you are employing a private detective,
for I don&rsquo;t think it a good plan to do it
secretly. It is never wise to antagonize the police;
they do all they can, popular prejudice to the contrary
notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and Olive gave me a
look of confidence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you do,
so long as you attend to it. I don&rsquo;t want to see
those horrid police people again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought to myself that she might be obliged
to do so, unless Penny Wise could find another way
to make them look. But I did not tell her so, for
nothing raised her ire like the hint of suspicion directed
toward herself in the matter of Amos
Gately&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare they!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes fairly
snapping with anger; &ldquo;to dream that I&mdash;Olive Raynor&mdash;could&mdash;why,
it&rsquo;s impossible to put it into
words!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>It did seem so. To look at that dainty, lovely
girl,&mdash;the very ideal of all that is best and gentlest
in human nature,&mdash;it was impossible to breathe the
word <i>murder</i> in the same breath!</p>
<p>I went away from the house, when my visit was
over, determined to track down the assassin,&mdash;with
the help of Penny Wise,&mdash;and thereby clear Olive&rsquo;s
name from the least taint of the ugly suspicion now
held by the police.</p>
<p class="tb">The next morning, in my office, I told Norah of
all the developments of Sunday.</p>
<p>The warm-hearted girl was deeply interested, and
eager for me to communicate with Wise at once,
for which purpose she slipped a fresh sheet of paper
in her typewriter, and waited for my dictation of a
letter to the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Norah,&rdquo; I laughed; &ldquo;give me
time to open my desk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I did dispatch the letter that morning, and
awaited the answer as impatiently as Norah herself.</p>
<p>And then I went down to Police Headquarters.</p>
<p>There a surprise was given me. The Chief had
received a letter that seemed to have a decided
bearing on the mystery of the murder. He handed
it to me without comment, and I read this:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To Police Headquarters;</p>
<p class="t2">New York City;</p>
<p class="t0">Sirs:</p>
</div>
<p>Last Wednesday afternoon, I was in New York,
and was in the Building of the Puritan Trust Company.
I had occasion to transact some business on
the tenth floor, and afterward, when waiting for the
elevator to take me down, I saw a pistol lying on
the floor of the hallway near the elevator. I picked
it up and put it in my pocket,&mdash;undecided, at the
moment, whether to consider it &ldquo;findings-keepings&rdquo;
(as it was a first-class one!) or whether to turn
it in at the superintendent&rsquo;s office. As a matter of
fact, when I reached the street floor I forgot all
about the thing, nor did I remember it until I was
back in Boston. And then, I read in the papers the
accounts of the murder in that same building, that
same afternoon, and I saw it was my duty to return
the pistol and acquaint you with these facts. But
alas, for dilatory human nature! I procrastinated
(without meaning to) until today, and now I send
this belated word, with an apology for my tardiness.
The pistol is safe in my possession, and I will hold
it pending your advices. Shall I send it to you,&mdash;and
how? Or shall I turn it over to the Boston
police? My knowledge of the whole matter begins
and ends with the finding of the pistol, which after
all, may have nothing to do with the crime. But I
found it at three o&rsquo;clock, or a very few minutes
after, if that interests you. I shall be here, at The
Touraine, for another week, and will cheerfully
allow myself to be interviewed at your convenience,
but, as I said, I have no further information to give
than that I have here set forth.</p>
<p><span class="center">Very truly yours,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Nicholas Lusk</span>.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p class="tb">The letter was dated from Boston, on Saturday
evening, two days before. Truly, Friend Lusk had
delayed his statement, but as he said, that was human
nature, in matters not important to oneself.</p>
<p>The Chief was furiously angry at the lateness of
the information, and had already dispatched a messenger
to get the weapon and to interview the Boston
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all straight on the face of it,&rdquo; declared
Chief Martin; &ldquo;only an honest, cheerful booby
would write like that! He picks up a pistol, forgets
all about it, and then, when he learns it&rsquo;s evidence,&mdash;or
may be,&mdash;he calmly waits forty-eight hours before
he pipes up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>the</i> pistol?&rdquo; I asked, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; blustered Martin. &ldquo;Likely
it is. I don&rsquo;t suppose half a dozen people sowed
pistols around that building at just three o&rsquo;clock
last Wednesday afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you fit it in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this way,&mdash;if you want to know. Miss&mdash;well,
that is,&mdash;whoever <i>did</i> do the shooting, ran
out of the third room, just as Jenny described,
and ran downstairs,&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether all
the way down or not, but at least to the tenth&mdash;two
floors below, and there dropped the pistol, either
by accident or by design, and proceeded to descend,
as I said, either by the stairs or by taking an elevator
at some intervening floor. Now, we want
that pistol. To be sure, it may not incriminate
anybody,&mdash;and yet, there&rsquo;s lots of individuality in
firearms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In detective stories the owner&rsquo;s initials are on
all well-conducted pistols,&rdquo; I remarked, casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in real life, though. There&rsquo;s a number
on them, of course, but that seldom helps. And
yet, I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that that pistol will tell its
own story, and my fingers itch to get a hold of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you expect it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent young Scanlon after it. He&rsquo;s a live
wire, and he&rsquo;ll get back soon&rsquo;s anybody could. See
here, this is the way I dope it out. If a woman
did the shooting, she&rsquo;d be more&rsquo;n likely to throw
away a pistol,&mdash;or to drop it unintentional like, in
her nervousness, but a man&mdash;nixy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had foreseen this. And the statement was, in
a way, true. A man, having committed murder,
does not drop his pistol,&mdash;unless, and I divulged
this thought to Martin, unless he wants to throw
suspicion on someone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was his curt response. &ldquo;Nobody
on that floor possible to suspect, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
Rodman,&mdash;and small chance of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rodman!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;why, he got on the elevator
at the seventh floor, just after the shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo; the Chief straightened up; &ldquo;how do
you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw him. I was going down,&mdash;in Minny&rsquo;s
elevator, you know,&mdash;to look for Jenny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes after the shooting&mdash;and of
course I got on at the twelfth floor, and there were
no other passengers at first, so I talked to Minny.
But at the seventh Rodman got on, and so we
stopped talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His office is on the tenth,&rdquo; mused Martin;
&ldquo;s&rsquo;posin&rsquo;&mdash;just s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d&mdash;er&mdash;he was implicated,
and that he ran downstairs afterward, to his
own floor, you know,&mdash;and then, later, walked to
seven, and took a car there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purposely leaving his pistol on his own floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, no! Dropped it accidentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said male criminals don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I say lots of things,&mdash;and you
would, too, if you were as bothered as I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Chief,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;and there is certainly
something to be looked into,&mdash;I should say,
without waiting for a report from Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet there is! I&rsquo;m going to send Hudson
right up there. He&rsquo;s as good a sleuth as we&rsquo;ve got,
and he&rsquo;ll deal with the Rodman matter in a right
and proper way. If there&rsquo;s nothing to find out,
Rodman will never know he looked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Hudson was duly dispatched, and I returned to
the Puritan Building. It was queer, but Rodman
had been in the back of my head all along,&mdash;and
yet, I had no real reason to think him implicated.
I did not know whether he knew Mr. Gately or
not, but I, too, had confidence in Foxy Jim Hudson&rsquo;s
discretion, and I was pretty positive he&rsquo;d find
out something,&mdash;if there were anything worth finding
out.</p>
<p>And there was!</p>
<p class="tb">Rodman, by good luck, was out and his offices
locked. Hudson gently persuaded the locks to let
go their grip, and, for he let me go with him, we
went in.</p>
<p>The first thing that hit me in the eyes, was a big
war map on the wall. Moreover, though not a
duplicate of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s map, it was similar, and it
hung in a similar position. That is, as Rodman&rsquo;s
offices were directly under those of the bank president,
two floors below, the rooms matched, and in
the &ldquo;third room&rdquo; as we called it in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
case, Rodman also had his map hung.</p>
<p>There was but one conclusion, and Hudson and I
sprang to it at once.</p>
<p>Together, we pulled aside the map, and sure
enough, there was a door exactly like the door
in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s room, a small, flush door, usually
hidden by the map.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the secret elevator, of course,&rdquo; I whispered
to Hudson, for walls have ears, and these walls
were in many ways peculiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly, it is!&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s open her
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forced the door open, and assured himself
that it did indeed lead into the private elevator
shaft, and there were the necessary buttons to cause
it to stop, if properly used. But now, the car being
down on the ground floor, where it had stayed ever
since the day of the murder, of course, the buttons
could not be manipulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hudson, his brow furrowed, &ldquo;to
see where else this bloomin&rsquo; rogue trap lets &rsquo;em
off! There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; mighty queer goin&rsquo; on that
we ain&rsquo;t caught on to yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carefully closed the door, readjusted the map,
and making sure we had left no traces of our visit,
he motioned me out and we went away.</p>
<p>He asked me to return to my office, and promised
to see me there later.</p>
<p>When he returned, he told me that he had visited
every other office in the building through whose
rooms the elevator shaft descended and in no other
instance was there an opening into the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which proves,&rdquo; he summed up, &ldquo;that Mr.
Gately and Mr. Rodman was somehow in cahoots,
else why would Rodman have access to that secret
elevator? Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>There were several possible answers. Rodman
might have taken his offices after the elevator was
built, and might never have used it at all. His map
might have hung over it merely to cover the useless
door.</p>
<p>Or, Rodman might have been a personal friend
of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s and used the little car for informal
visits.</p>
<p>Again,&mdash;though I hated myself for the thought,&mdash;Mr.
Gately might have had guests whom he didn&rsquo;t
wish to be seen entering his rooms, and he might
have had an arrangement with Rodman whereby
the visitors could go in and out through his rooms,
and take the private elevator between the tenth and
twelfth floors.</p>
<p>I distrusted Rodman; without any definite reason,
but all the same I did distrust him, and I have
frequently found my intuitions regarding strangers
hit pretty nearly right.</p>
<p>It was unnecessary, however, to answer Foxy
Jim&rsquo;s question, for he answered it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about Mr. Gately,&rdquo; he said,
and he spoke seriously, almost solemnly, &ldquo;that
hasn&rsquo;t come to light yet, but it&rsquo;s bound to. Yes,
sir, it&rsquo;s bound to! And it&rsquo;s on the way. Now, if
we can hook up that Boston pistol with Mr. George
Rodman, well and good; if we can&rsquo;t, Rodman&rsquo;s got
to be put through the grill anyhow. He&rsquo;s in it for
keeps&mdash;that elevator door isn&rsquo;t easily explained
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Rodman,&rdquo; it was Norah who spoke,
and as before, Hudson turned to her almost expectantly&mdash;he
seemed to depend on her for suggestions,
or at least, he always listened to them&mdash;&ldquo;I
wonder, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she went on slowly, &ldquo;does
Mr. Rodman look at all like the figure you saw in
the shadow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, decidedly, &ldquo;he does! Now, hold
on, Hudson, it&rsquo;s only a memory, you know, and I
may easily be mistaken. But it seems to me I can
remember a real resemblance between that shadowed
head and the head of George Rodman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth an experiment,&rdquo; returned the foxy
detective, and on the strength of his decision he
waited in my office until George Rodman returned
to his.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, at the time, what argument Hudson
used to get Rodman to do it, but his foxiness
prevailed and, obeying orders, I found myself
watching the shadow of George Rodman&rsquo;s head on
Amos Gately&rsquo;s glass door, as Hudson engaged his
suspect in animated conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the scene of the crime was not re-enacted,
there was merely the shadowed picture of
the two men, but Hudson managed to have Rodman
conspicuously shadowed in various positions
and postures.</p>
<p class="tb">And after it was over, and Hudson, back in my
office, asked me for my verdict, I was obliged to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hudson, if that is not the man I saw quarreling
with Mr. Gately, it is his exact counterpart!
Were it a less grave occasion, I should not hesitate
to swear that it is the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and Foxy Jim Hudson
went back to Headquarters with his report.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />Penny Wise and Zizi</h2>
<p>And so it was at this stage of affairs that Pennington
Wise got into the game. He willingly
agreed to take up the case, for the
mystery of it appealed to him strongly, and by a
stroke of good luck he was not otherwise engaged.</p>
<p>He had promised to call at Miss Raynor&rsquo;s, and as
she had asked me to be present also, I went up
there, reaching the house before Wise did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; Olive inquired of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-looking sort of chap, without being handsome,&rdquo;
I told her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like his personality,
I&rsquo;m sure, whether he helps us out of our troubles
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a fig for his personality,&rdquo; she returned,
&ldquo;but I do want him to solve our two mysteries.
I suppose you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m dreadful,&mdash;but
I&rsquo;d rather Mr. Wise would find Amory Manning for
me, than to discover Uncle Amos&rsquo; murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you at all for that. Of course,
we want to find the criminal, but even more, I too,
want to find Mr. Manning for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, anyway, I suppose the police think now
that Mr. Rodman did it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t go so far as to say that, but they&rsquo;re
hunting up evidence, and they&rsquo;ve got hold of some
pretty damaging information. It seems Rodman
was mixed up in some wrongdoing, and it begins to
look as if Mr. Gately was in some way connected
with it,&mdash;at least, to a degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he was, then he didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong.&rdquo;
Olive spoke with deep conviction, and I didn&rsquo;t try
to disabuse her mind.</p>
<p>And then Pennington Wise was announced.</p>
<p>As he entered the room his manner showed no
trace of self-consciousness, and as I had anticipated,
Olive was greatly pleased with her first glimpse of
him. But to her surprise, and mine also, he was
accompanied, or rather followed, by a young
woman, a mere slip of a girl, who paused and stood
quietly by.</p>
<p>As Olive smiled at her inquiringly, Wise said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Zizi. She&rsquo;s part of my working paraphernalia,
and will just sit and listen while we
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was fascinating to look at. Slight of
build, she had a lithe suppleness that made her
every motion a gesture of grace, and her pretty
smile was appreciative and responsive. She had
black hair and very black eyes, which sparkled and
danced as she took in her surroundings. But she
said no word, acknowledging her brief introduction
only by a slight bow, and accepting the chair that
Olive offered, she sat quietly, her small gloved
hands resting in her lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>She wore a black suit with a fine set of black
fox furs. Unfastening the fur collar, she disclosed
a black blouse of soft, thin material which fell away
from her slender white throat in becoming fashion.</p>
<p>Her manner was correct in every particular, and
she sat in an unembarrassed silence as Wise proceeded
to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that has been in the papers,&rdquo; he said,
somewhat abruptly, &ldquo;now, I&rsquo;d like you to tell me
the rest. I can&rsquo;t help feeling there must be more
in the way of evidence or clews than has been
made public. First of all, do <i>you</i> think Mr. Rodman
the guilty man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He addressed himself mainly to Olive, though including
me in his inquiring glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Olive returned; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t believe, however, that Amos Gately was involved
in any sort of wrong. His honor and
integrity were of the highest type,&mdash;I knew him
intimately enough to certify to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of wrongdoing is this Rodman
accused of?&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody seems willing to tell that,&rdquo; I answered,
as Olive shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve inquired of the
police, and they decline to reveal just what they do
suspect him of. But I think it&rsquo;s something pretty
serious, and they&rsquo;re tracking it down as fast as
they can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Olive put in, &ldquo;if Mr. Rodman is such
a bad man, he may have hoodwinked Mr. Gately
and made him believe something was all right when
it was all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he might,&rdquo; said Wise, sympathetically.
&ldquo;Did people come here to the house to see
Mr. Gately on business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; never. Uncle had few visitors, but they
were always just his friends, not business
callers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then most of our search must be in his offices.
You noticed nothing there, Mr. Brice, that seemed
indicative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I told him about the hatpin and the carriage
check; and I also related how Norah had found and
kept the &ldquo;powder-paper&rdquo; that she picked out of
the waste basket.</p>
<p>Zizi&rsquo;s eyes flashed at this, and she said, &ldquo;Has she
traced it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time the girl had spoken, and I
was charmed with her voice. Low and soft, it had
also a bell-like quality, and seemed to leave a ringing
echo in the air after she ceased speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; to the shop where it was bought,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;As Norah guessed, it came from a very
high-class perfumer&rsquo;s on Fifth Avenue. But of
course he could not tell us to whom he had sold
that particular paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it,&rdquo; said Zizi, simply, and again
relapsed into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Norah must be a bright girl,&rdquo; observed Wise,
&ldquo;and she has made a good start by finding the
shop. Perhaps we can carry the trail further. It
wasn&rsquo;t yours, Miss Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I use a paler tint. This one, I have seen
it, is quite a deep pink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indicating a brunette possibly. Now, it&rsquo;s not
likely it belonged to that old Mrs. Driggs, so we
must assume another woman in the office that day.
And we must discover who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the hatpin, you know,&rdquo; said Olive.
&ldquo;I have it here, if you care to see it. But the
police decided it meant nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing means nothing,&rdquo; said Zizi, with a
funny little smile. &ldquo;Please let us see the hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive took it from a desk drawer and handed it to
the girl, who immediately passed it over to Penny
Wise.</p>
<p>He looked at it with interest, for a silent minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t be a better <i>portrait parl&eacute;</i>!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;This pin belongs to a lady with dark,
straight hair,&mdash;coarse, and lots of it. She has good
teeth, and she is proud of them. Her tastes incline
to the flashy, and she is fond of strong perfumes.
She is of somewhat untidy habits and
given to sentiment. She is intellectual and efficient
and, if not wealthy, she has at least a competence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gracious goodness sake!&rdquo; gasped Olive;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve studied that hatpin for hours and never
could deduce a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I have read from it may be of no use to
us,&rdquo; said Wise, indifferently; &ldquo;I think it will be a
sufficient indication of which way to look to find
the lady in question, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
mean the finding of her will do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she may know something to tell us that will
do good,&rdquo; Olive suggested; &ldquo;at any rate, let&rsquo;s find
her. How will you go about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think it will be a good plan to ask the
stenographer, Jenny Boyd, if she ever saw anyone
there who fits our description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the lady of the powder-paper, maybe,&rdquo;
murmured Zizi, and Penny Wise said, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;
in a preoccupied way, and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Jenny person must be further grilled. She
hasn&rsquo;t told all she knows. She was in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
employ but a short time and yet she picked up a lot
of information. But she hasn&rsquo;t divulged it all, not
by a long shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; asked Olive, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read the papers. I have an unbreakable
habit of reading between the lines, and I think Miss
Jenny has been persuaded by somebody to suppress
certain interesting bits of evidence that would fit
right into our picture puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; said a gentle voice, and Mrs.
Vail appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>As we rose to greet her, Olive presented Mr.
Wise, and then Mrs. Vail permitted herself the luxury
of a stare of genuine curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>His whimsical smile charmed her, and she was
most cordial of speech and manner. Indeed, so absorbed
was she in this new acquaintance that she
didn&rsquo;t even see Zizi, who sat, as always, back and in
the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vail, fluttering
into a chair. &ldquo;Just go on as if I were not here.
I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> interested, just let me listen! I won&rsquo;t say
a word. Oh, Olive dear, did you show Mr. Wise the
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s unimportant,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it is, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Vail
persisted. &ldquo;You know it might be a&mdash;what
do they call it?&mdash;a clew. Why, I knew a lady
once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter is always important,&rdquo; said Zizi from
her corner, and Mrs. Vail jumped and gave a
startled exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she cried, peering through her
<i>lorgnon</i> in the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show yourself, Zizi,&rdquo; directed Wise. &ldquo;This is
my assistant, Mrs. Vail. She is in our council but
not of it. I can&rsquo;t explain her exactly, but you&rsquo;ll
come to understand her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zizi leaned forward and gave Mrs. Vail a pleasant
if indifferent smile, then sank back to her usual
obscurity.</p>
<p>The girl was, Wise had said, a negligible personality,
and yet whenever she spoke she said something!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Mrs. Vail looked bewildered, but apparently she
was prepared to accept anything, however strange,
in connection with detective work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;as that pretty little thing
says, a letter is always important, and I think you
ought to show it, Olive. I had a letter once that
changed the whole current of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this letter, Miss Raynor?&rdquo; asked Wise,
in a matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One I received in this morning&rsquo;s mail,&rdquo; Olive
replied; &ldquo;I paid no attention to it, because it was
anonymous. Uncle Amos told me once never to
notice an anonymous letter,&mdash;always to burn and
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough advice, in general,&rdquo; said Wise;
&ldquo;but in such serious matters as we have before us
any letter is of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the letter written by a woman, and signed
&lsquo;A Friend&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Zizi in her soft voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you write it?&rdquo; cried Olive, turning to the
wraith-like girl who sat so quietly behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no! <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t write it,&rdquo; and the
demure little face showed a fleeting smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you know? For it <i>is</i> signed &lsquo;A
Friend,&rsquo; but I don&rsquo;t know whether it was a woman
who wrote it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; and Zizi nodded her sleek little black
head. She had removed her hat and placed it on
a nearby chair, and as she nestled into her furs
which formed a dark background, her small white
face looked more eerie than ever. &ldquo;Ninety per
cent. of all anonymous letters are written by women,
and ninety per cent. of these are signed &lsquo;A Friend.&rsquo;
Though usually that is a misstatement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see the letter?&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Zizi who spoke! And rising, she went
swiftly across the room, to a desk, and from a
pigeonhole took an opened letter, which she carried
to Wise, and then dropped back into her seat again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail gave a surprised gasp, and Olive looked
her amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know where to find that?&rdquo; she
exclaimed, her great brown eyes wide with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead easy,&rdquo; said Zizi, nonchalantly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
scarcely taken your eyes off that spot, Miss Raynor,
since the letter was mentioned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even though I looked at the desk, how
could you pick out the very letter, at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I looked at the desk, too. And I saw your
morning&rsquo;s mail, pretty well sorted out. There&rsquo;s a
pile of bills, a pile of what are unmistakably social
notes, and, up above in a pigeonhole, all by itself,
was this letter. You glanced at it a dozen times or
more, so I couldn&rsquo;t help knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive laughed. One couldn&rsquo;t help liking the
strange girl whose expression was so earnest, even
while her black eyes were dancing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Penny Wise examined the missive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it aloud?&rdquo; and he glanced at Olive,
who acquiesced by a nod.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Miss Raynor</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit looking for slayer of A.G. or you&rsquo;ll be
railroaded in yourself. This is straight goods. Call
off all Tecs, or beware consequences. Will not
warn twice!</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">A Friend.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; Pennington Wise said in a musing
voice, after he read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A business woman,&rdquo; added Zizi from her
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stenographer maybe,&rdquo; Wise went on, and
Olive cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; this is written by a woman with more
brains than Jenny ever dreamed of. A very clever
woman in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; breathed Olive, her eager face flushing
in her interest and anxious to know more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, Miss Raynor, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wise,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Vail; &ldquo;you are
so wonderful! Won&rsquo;t you explain how you do it,
as you go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke as if he were a conjurer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to oblige,&rdquo; Wise assented. &ldquo;Well,
here&rsquo;s how it looks to me. The writer of this letter
is a business woman, not only because she uses this
large, single sheet of bond paper, but because she
knows how to use it. She is a stenographer,&mdash;by
that I do not necessarily mean that is her business,&mdash;she
may have a knowledge of stenography,
and be in some much more important line of work.
But she is an accomplished typist and a rapid one.
This, I know, of course, from the neat and uniform
typing. She is clever, because she has used this
non-committal paper, which is in no way especial
or individual. She is a business woman, again, because
she uses such expressions as &lsquo;quit,&rsquo; railroaded,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tecs,&rsquo; &lsquo;straight goods,&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which she might do by way of being misleading&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
murmured Zizi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many of &rsquo;em, and too casually used, Ziz.
A society girl trying to pose as a business woman
never would have rolled those words in so easily.
I should have said a newspaper woman but for a
certain peculiarity of style which indicates,&mdash;what,
Zizi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it; a telegraph operator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Do you know any telegrapher, Miss
Raynor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; and Olive looked astounded at the
suggestion that she should number such among her
acquaintances. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks mighty like it. The short sentences and
the elimination of personal pronouns seem to me to
denote a telegraph girl&rsquo;s diction. And she is very
clever! She has sent the carbon copy of the letter
and not the outside typing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To make it less traceable. You know, typewriting
is very nearly as individual as pen-writing.
The differentiations of the machine as well as of the
user&rsquo;s technique, are almost invariably so pronounced
as to make the writing recognizable. Now
these peculiarities, while often clear on the first
paper, are blurred more or less on the carbon copy.
So &lsquo;A Friend,&rsquo; thinking to be very canny, has sent
the carbon. This is a new trick, though I&rsquo;ve seen
it done several times of late. But it isn&rsquo;t so misleading
as it is thought to be. For all the individual
peculiarities of the typewriter,&mdash;I mean, the machine,
are almost as visible on this as on the other.
I&rsquo;ve noticed them in this case, easily. And moreover,
this would-be clever writer has overreached
herself! For a carbon copy smudges so easily that
it is almost impossible to touch it, even to fold the
sheet, without leaving a telltale thumb or finger
print! And this correspondent has most obligingly
done so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; breathed Zizi, with a note of satisfaction
in her low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the peculiarities,&mdash;what are they?&rdquo; asked
Olive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that jumps out and hits me first is the
elevated <i>s</i>. Look,&mdash;and you have to look closely,
Miss Raynor,&mdash;in every instance the letter <i>s</i> is a
tiny speck higher than the other letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it is,&rdquo; and Olive examined the letter
with deep interest; &ldquo;but how can you find a machine
with an elevated <i>s</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a sign-board, it&rsquo;s a proof. When we
think we have the right machine, the <i>s</i> will prove
it,&mdash;not lead us to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; begged Mrs. Vail, reaching for the
paper. &ldquo;A friend of mine is a stenographer; maybe
she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; and Penny Wise folded the letter
most carefully. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get any more finger
prints on this paper, or we shall render it useless.
Now, Miss Raynor, I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;ll take the letter,
and I&rsquo;ve little doubt it will be a great help to me in
my work. I will report to you from time to time,
but it may be a few days before I learn anything
of importance. Zizi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; and the girl sat quietly in
her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means she&rsquo;ll take up her abode with you
for the present, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; and Wise smiled at
Olive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please. It is necessary, or she wouldn&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let her stay!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vail; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so
interesting&mdash;and queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The object of her comment gave her an engaging
smile, but said nothing, and beckoning me to go
with him, Wise rose to take leave.</p>
<p>But I wanted to have a little further talk with
Olive on several matters and I told Wise I&rsquo;d join
him a little later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be goody-girl, Zizi,&rdquo; he adjured as he went off,
and she nodded her head, but with a saucy grimace
at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My room?&rdquo; she said, inquiringly, with a pretty,
shy glance at Olive. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no trouble,&mdash;not a bit.
Any little old room, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it in a few moments,&rdquo; and
Olive went away to see the housemaids
about it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail snatched at a chance to talk uninterruptedly
to the strange girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your work?&rdquo; she inquired; &ldquo;do you
help Mr. Wise? Isn&rsquo;t he wonderful! How you
must admire him. I knew a detective once,&mdash;or,
at least, a man who was going to be a detective,
but&mdash;&mdash; Oh, <i>do</i> tell me what your part of the
work is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sit by,&rdquo; returned Zizi, with a dear little grin
that took off all edge of curtness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit by! Is that some technical term? I don&rsquo;t
quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always understand myself,&rdquo; and the girl
shook her head slowly; &ldquo;but I just remain silent
until Mr. Wise wants me to speak,&mdash;to tell him
something, you know. Then I tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do <i>you</i> know it?&rdquo; I put in, fascinated
by this strange child, for she looked little more than
a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; Zizi shuddered, and drew her small self
together, her black eyes round and uncanny-looking;
&ldquo;ooh! I donno how I know! I guess the bogie man
tells me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail shuddered too, and gave a little shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a witch,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;own up, now,
aren&rsquo;t you a witch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lady, lady! I <i>am</i> a witch,&mdash;a poor little
witch girl!&rdquo; and Zizi laughed outright at her own
little joke.</p>
<p>If her smile had been charming, her laugh was
more so. It was not only of a silvery trill, but it
was infectious, and Mrs. Vail and I laughed in
sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you all laughing at?&rdquo; said Olive, reappearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At me,&rdquo; and Zizi spoke humbly now; &ldquo;I made
&rsquo;em laugh. Sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me, you funny child,&rdquo; and
Olive led her away, leaving me to be the victim of
Mrs. Vail&rsquo;s incessant stream of chatter.</p>
<p>The good lady volubly discussed the detective and
his assistant and detailed many accounts of people
she had known. Her acquaintance was seemingly a
wide one!</p>
<p>At last Olive returned, smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything like her!&rdquo; she exclaimed;
&ldquo;I gave her a pretty little room, not far from mine.
I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure, why she&rsquo;s staying here, but
I like to have her. Well, in about two minutes she
had the furniture all changed about. Not the heavy
pieces, of course, but she moved a small table and
all the chairs, and finally unscrewed an electric light
bulb from one place and put it on another, and then,
after looking all about, she said, &lsquo;Just one thing
more!&rsquo; and if she didn&rsquo;t spring up on to a table
with one jump and take down quite a large picture!
&lsquo;There,&rsquo; she said, and she set it out in the hall;
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear that thing! Now this is a lovely
room, and I thank you, Miss Raynor. The pink one
we passed is yours, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; how did you know?&rsquo; I asked her. And
she said, &lsquo;I saw a photograph of Mr. Manning on
your bureau.&rsquo; Little rascal! I can&rsquo;t help liking
her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />Case Rivers</h2>
<p>So absorbed was I in the new interests that had
come into my life, so anxious to be of assistance
to Olive Raynor, and so curious to watch
the procedure of Pennington Wise, that I confess I
forgot all about the poor chap I had seen at Bellevue
Hospital,&mdash;the man who &ldquo;fell through the
earth&rdquo;! And I&rsquo;m not sure I should ever have
thought of him again, save as a fleeting memory,
if I hadn&rsquo;t received a letter from him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dear Brice [he wrote]: I&rsquo;ve no right to pilfer
your time, but if you have a few minutes to
squander, I wish you&rsquo;d give them to me. I&rsquo;m about
to be discharged from the hospital, with a clean
bill of health,&mdash;but with no hint or clew as to my
cherished identity. The doctors&mdash;drat &rsquo;em!&mdash;say
that some day my memory will spring, full-armed,
back at me, but meanwhile, I must just sit tight
and wait. Not being of a patient disposition, I&rsquo;m
going to get busy at acquiring a new identity, then,
if the old one ever does spring a come-back, I&rsquo;ll have
two,&mdash;and can lead a double life! No, I&rsquo;m not
flippant, I&rsquo;m philosophical. Well, if your offer
didn&rsquo;t have a string tied to it come in to see me,&mdash;please.</p>
<p><span class="center">Sincerely yours,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Case Rivers</span>.</span></p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;The doctors look upon me as a very important
and interesting case,&mdash;hence my name.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>I smiled at the note, and as I had taken a liking
to the man from the start, I went at once to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I assured him, after receiving his cordial
welcome, &ldquo;my offer had no string attached. I&rsquo;m
more than ready to help in any way I can, to find a
niche for you in this old town and fit you into it.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you hail from, or how you
got here; New York is an all-comers&rsquo; race, and the
devil take the hindmost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get me, then,&rdquo; and Rivers nodded his
head determinedly; &ldquo;I may not be in the van, just
at first, but give me half a chance, and I&rsquo;ll make
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not bumptiousness or braggadocio, I
could see, but an earnest determination. The man
was sincere and he had a certain doggedness of
purpose, which was evident in his looks and manner
as well as in his words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Rivers was up and dressed now, and I saw he
was a good-looking chap. His light-brown hair
was carefully parted and brushed; his smooth-shaven
face was thin and pale, but showed strong
lines of character. He had been fitted with
glasses,&mdash;a <i>pince-nez</i>, held by a tiny gold chain over
one ear,&mdash;and this corrected the vacant look in his
eyes. His clothes were inexpensive and quite unmistakably
ready-made.</p>
<p>He was apologetic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have better
duds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but as I had to borrow money to
clothe myself at all, I didn&rsquo;t want to splurge. One
doctor here is a brick! He&rsquo;s going to follow up my
&lsquo;case,&rsquo; and so I accepted his loan. It&rsquo;s a fearful
predicament to be a live, grown-up man, without a
cent to your name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be your banker,&rdquo; I offered, in all sincerity;
&ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want coin so much as I want a
way to earn some. Now, if you&rsquo;ll put me in the
way of getting work,&mdash;anything that pays pretty
well,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be obliged, sir, and I&rsquo;ll be on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile was of that frank, chummy sort that
makes for sympathy and I agreed to help him in
any way I could think of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; I asked, preliminarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Have to investigate myself, and learn
what are my latent talents. Doubtless their name is
legion. But I&rsquo;ve nailed one of them. I can draw!
Witness these masterpieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up some sheets of scribble paper on which
I saw several careful and well-done mechanical
drawings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a draughtsman!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;in
that lost life of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I may have been. Anyway,
these things are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything. They&rsquo;re sort of designs
for wall-paper or oilcloth. See? Merely suggestions,
you know, but this one, repeated, would make
a ripping study for a two-toned paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I exclaimed, in admiration of
the pattern. &ldquo;You must have been a designer of
such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what I <i>was</i>,&mdash;the thing is what can I
be now, to take my place in the economic world.
These are, do you see, adaptations from snow crystals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are! It takes me back to my school
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m harking back to those, too. I
remember the pictures of snow crystals in &lsquo;Steele&rsquo;s
Fourteen Weeks in Natural Science.&rsquo; Did you
study that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; I replied, grinning; &ldquo;in high school!
But, is your memory returning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d notice it! I have recollection of
all I learned in an educational way, but I can&rsquo;t
see any individual picture of <i>me</i>, personally,&mdash;oh,
never mind! How can I get a position as master
designer in some great factory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big order,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;But you can
begin in a small way and rise to a proud eminence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanky! I&rsquo;m not as young as I once was,&mdash;my
favorite doctor puts me down at thirty,&mdash;plus
or minus,&mdash;but I feel about sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Rivers, do you feel like an old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not physically,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the queer part. But I
feel as if my life was all behind me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s because of your temporary mental&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. And I&rsquo;m going to conquer it,&mdash;or
get around it some way. Now, if you&rsquo;ll introduce
me,&mdash;and, yes, act as my guarantee, my reference,&mdash;I
know it&rsquo;s asking a lot, but if you&rsquo;ll do that, I&rsquo;ll
make good, I promise you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you will, and I&rsquo;m only too glad to do
it. I&rsquo;ll take you, whenever you say, around to a
firm I know of, that I believe will be jolly glad to
get you. You see, so many men of your gifts have
gone to war&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, and I&rsquo;d like to enlist myself, but
Doc says I can&rsquo;t, being a&mdash;a defective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you were a detective instead,&rdquo; I said,
partly to turn the current of his thoughts from his
condition and partly because my mind was so full of
my own interests that he was a secondary consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be. I&rsquo;ve been reading a bunch of
detective stories since I&rsquo;ve been here in hospital,
and I don&rsquo;t see as that deduction business is such a
great stunt. Sherlock Holmes is all right, but most
of his imitators are stuff and nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>And then, unable to hold it back any longer, I told
him all about the Gately case and about Pennington
Wise.</p>
<p>He was deeply interested, and his eyes sparkled
when I related Wise&rsquo;s deductions from the hatpin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he proved it yet?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;have you
checked him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there hasn&rsquo;t been time. He&rsquo;s only just
started his work. He has another task; to find
Amory Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who has disappeared, and there is fear
of foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he suspected of killing Gately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not that; but he was suspected of
hiding to shield Miss Raynor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! a girl wouldn&rsquo;t commit a murder like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this girl did, anyway. And, in
fact, they&mdash;the police I mean&mdash;have a new suspect.
There&rsquo;s a man named Rodman, who is being looked
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all a great game! I wish I could get
out into the world and take part in such
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, old man. Once you&rsquo;re fairly started,
the world will be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cellar-door! You bet it will! I&rsquo;m going
to slide right down it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about your falling through it? Do you
remember any more details of that somewhat&mdash;er&mdash;unusual
performance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do! And you can laugh all you like.
That&rsquo;s no hallucination, it&rsquo;s a clear, true memory,&mdash;the
only memory I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That journey through the earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been reading Jules Verne lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never read it. But that long journey down,
down,&mdash;miles and miles,&mdash;I can never forget it!
I&rsquo;ve had a globe to look at, and I suppose I must
have started thousands of miles from here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, come off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use. I can&rsquo;t make anybody believe
it, but it&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write it up for the movies. The Man Who
Fell Through the Earth would be a stunning
title!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re guying me again. Guess I&rsquo;ll shut
up on that subject. But I&rsquo;ll stick you for one more
helping-hand act. Where can I get a room to live
in for a short time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a short time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I must take a dinky little cheap place at
first, then soon, I&rsquo;ll be on my feet, financially speaking,
and I can move to decenter quarters. You see,
I&rsquo;m going to ask you after all to trust me with a
few shekels, right now, and I&rsquo;ll return the loan,
with interest, at no far distant date.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>His calm assumption of success in a business way
impressed me favorably. Undoubtedly, he had been
one accustomed to making and spending money in
his previous life, and he took it as a matter of
course. But his common sense, which had by no
means deserted him, made him aware that he could
get no satisfactory position without some sort of
credentials.</p>
<p>As he talked he was idly, it seemed, unconsciously,
drawing on the paper pad that lay on the
table at his elbow&mdash;delicate penciled marks that
resolved themselves into six-sided figures, whose
radii blossomed out into beautiful tendrils or spikes
until they formed a perfect, harmonious whole; each
section alike, just as in a snow crystal.</p>
<p>They were so exquisitely done that I marveled at
his peculiar gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to design lace,&rdquo; I observed; &ldquo;those
designs are too fine for papers or carpets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; he returned, seriously gazing at
his drawings. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll design something,&mdash;and
it&rsquo;ll be something worthwhile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you were an engraver,&rdquo; I hazarded,
&ldquo;before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I fell through the earth? Maybe I was.
Well, then, suppose tomorrow I so far encroach on
your good offices as to go with you to see the firm
you mentioned. Or, if you&rsquo;ll give me a letter of
introduction&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know your way around New York?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I have a feeling I was in New
York once,&mdash;a long time ago, but I can&rsquo;t say for
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you then. I&rsquo;ll call for you tomorrow,
and escort you to the office I have in mind,
and also, look up a home and fireside that appeals
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sort that appeals to me is out of the question
at present,&rdquo; he said, firmly determined to put
himself under no greater obligation to me than
need be. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose a room like the old gentleman
in the Bible had with a bed and a table and a stool
and a candlestick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember your literature all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, mostly; though I&rsquo;ll confess I read of that
ascetic individual since I&rsquo;ve been here. The hospital
is long on Bibles and detective stories, and
short on <i>belles-lettres</i>. Well, so long, old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went away, pondering. It was a strange case,
this of Case Rivers. I smiled at the name he had
chosen.</p>
<p>He was positively a well-educated and well-read
man. His speech gave me a slight impression of
an Englishman, and I wondered if he might be
Canadian. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t believe an atom of
his yarn about coming from Canada to our fair
city <i>via</i> the interior of the globe,&mdash;but he may have
had a lapse of memory that included his railroad
journey, and dreamed that he came in some fantastic
way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>And then, as is usual, when leaving one scene for
another, my thoughts flew ahead to my next errand,
which was a visit to Police Headquarters.</p>
<p>Here Chief Martin gave me a lot of new information.
It seemed they had unearthed damaging evidence
in the case of George Rodman, and he was,
without a doubt, a malefactor,&mdash;but in what particular
branch of evil the Chief omitted to state.
Nor could any rather broad hints produce any
result. At last I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you arrest Rodman, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough definite evidence. I&rsquo;m just about
sure that he killed Gately, and I think I know why,
but I can&rsquo;t prove it,&mdash;yet. Your statement that his
head shadowed on that glass door was the same
head you saw the day of the murder, is our strongest
point&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; I cried, aghast; &ldquo;I do
say it looked like the same head, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
swear that it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it was, and though we can&rsquo;t connect
up the pistol with Rodman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get the pistol from the Boston man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Scanlon brought home that bacon. But
careful grilling failed to get any more information
from Lusk, the man who found the pistol. He
tells a straight tale of his visit to the Puritan Building,
and his business there, all corroborated by the
people he called on. He found that pistol, just as
he says he did. And, of course, I knew he told the
truth in his letter. If he were involved, or had any
guilty knowledge of the crime, he surely wouldn&rsquo;t
write to tell us of it! So now we have the pistol,
and we know it was picked up in the tenth floor
hall near Rodman&rsquo;s door,&mdash;but that proves nothing,
since we can&rsquo;t claim it is Rodman&rsquo;s weapon. It
may be, of course, but there&rsquo;s nothing to show it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Rodman say for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denies everything. Says he had the merest
nodding acquaintance with Gately,&mdash;this we know
is a lie!&mdash;says he knew there was an elevator door
in his room, but he had never used it, nor even
opened it. Said he hung a big war map over it because
it was a good place for a map. We&rsquo;ve no
living witness to give a shred of evidence against
Rodman, except your statement about his shadow,&mdash;and
that is uncertain at best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. I do say it looked like Rodman&rsquo;s
head,&mdash;that is, I mean, Rodman&rsquo;s head looked like
the one I saw that day. But other heads might
look as much like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. George Rodman is a slick
chap, and what he does that he doesn&rsquo;t want known,
doesn&rsquo;t get known! But I&rsquo;m onto him! And I&rsquo;ll
bet I&rsquo;ll get him yet. He&rsquo;s so comfoundedly cool
that all I say to him rolls off like water off a duck&rsquo;s
back. He knows I&rsquo;ve got no proof, and he&rsquo;s banking
on that to get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Jenny? Can&rsquo;t she tell you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She knows nothing about Rodman. And that
very point proves that if he visited Gately often,
as I think he did, he came and went by that private
elevator which connected their two offices, as well as
made a street exit for either or both of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did old man Boyd ever see Rodman leave the
Matteawan by way of that elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he never did, but sometimes I think
Rodman has fixed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jenny, too, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. And here&rsquo;s another thing. There&rsquo;s
somebody called &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; who figures largely in
the whole affair, but figures secretly. I won&rsquo;t say
how I found this little joker, but if I can dig up
who &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; is, I&rsquo;ve made a great stride toward
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally, I said nothing about Pennington Wise
to the Chief of Police, but I made a mental note
of &ldquo;The Link&rdquo; to report to the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reward&rsquo;s offered,&rdquo; we were suddenly informed,
as Foxy Jim Hudson burst into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; asked the Chief, a little absent-mindedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For information leading to the whereabouts of
Amory Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin wheeled round in his chair to look at his
subordinate. &ldquo;Who offered it? How much?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part, Chief. Not the amount,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
five thousand dollars, but it&rsquo;s a person or persons
unknown who will put up the kale. It&rsquo;s done
through the firm of Kellogg and Kellogg,&mdash;about
the whitest bunch of lawyers in town. I mean whoever
offers that reward is somebody worthwhile.
No shyster business. I&rsquo;m for it,&mdash;the money, I
mean. Do you know, Chief, the disappearance of
that Manning chap is in some way connected with
the Gately murder? I&rsquo;ve got a hunch on that. And
here&rsquo;s how I dope it out. Manning saw Rodman,&mdash;well,
perhaps he didn&rsquo;t see him shoot, but he saw
something that incriminated Rodman, and so he,&mdash;Rodman,
had to get Manning out of the way. And
did! You see, Friend Rodman is not only a deep-dyed
scoundrel,&mdash;but the dye was &lsquo;made in Germany&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad the reward is offered,&rdquo; commented
the Chief. &ldquo;Now some rank outsider&rsquo;ll
pipe up and speak his little piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning anybody in particular?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>With that peculiarly irritating trick of his, Chief
Martin not only made no reply but gave no evidence
of having heard my question. He went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes two rewards. The Puritan Trust
Company has offered five thousand for the apprehension
of Gately&rsquo;s murderer. This other five thousand
adds to the excitement and ought to produce a
good result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out for both,&rdquo; announced Hudson. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
say I expect to get &rsquo;em, but I&rsquo;ll make a fierce stab at
it. Rodman has an awful big income, and no visible
means of support. That fact ought to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it proves to my mind that he was mixed
up in lucrative business that he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;well&mdash;advertise.
&lsquo;The Link&rsquo; was mixed in, too. That is,&mdash;I
suppose,&mdash;&lsquo;The Link&rsquo; was a sort of go-between,
who enabled Rodman to transact his nefarious deals
secretly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Foxy, you know a lot,&rdquo; and the Chief
laughed good-humoredly.</p>
<p>I felt that I now knew a lot, too, and as I went
away I determined to see Penny Wise at once, and
report all I had learned. I dropped in first at my
own office, and found Norah in a brown study, her
hands behind her head and a half-written letter in
her typewriter.</p>
<p>She gazed at me absently, and then, noting my
air of excitement, she became alert and exclaimed,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened? What do you know new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps,&rdquo; I vouchsafed, and then I told her,
briefly, of Rodman&rsquo;s probable guilt and also of the
offered rewards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;s your trump card,&rdquo; she said after a
thoughtful silence. &ldquo;That girl knows a good deal
that she hasn&rsquo;t told. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she&rsquo;s
in Rodman&rsquo;s employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s too glib. She admits so many things
that she has seen or heard and then when you ask
her about others, she is a blank wall. Now, she
does know about them, but she won&rsquo;t tell. Why?
Because she&rsquo;s paid not to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can we get around her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay her more.&rdquo; And Norah returned to her
typing. But she looked up again to say: &ldquo;Mrs.
Russell called here about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did! What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She wanted to see you. She was
a bit forlorn, so I talked to her a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did. Poor lady, she feels her
brother&rsquo;s absence terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we discussed it. She thinks he has been
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she any reason to think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, except that she dreamed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most natural dream for a nervous, worried
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I wonder if she knows there&rsquo;s a reward
offered for Mr. Manning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she offered it,&mdash;through the Kellogg
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, how do you know, oh, modern Cassandra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your old friend Cassandra, but I
do know Mrs. Russell isn&rsquo;t offering any five thousand
dollars. She can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s a rich woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She passes for one, and, of course, she isn&rsquo;t
suffering for food or clothes. But she is economizing.
She was wearing her last year&rsquo;s hat and muff,
and she maids herself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she wore her old clothes because she
was merely out to call on my unworthy self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She was on her way to a reception.
They&rsquo;re her best clothes now. And a tiny rip in
one glove and a missing snap-fastener on her
bodice proves she keeps no personal lady&rsquo;s maid, as
people in her position usually do. So, I&rsquo;m sure she
isn&rsquo;t offering big reward money, though she loves
her brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a born detectivess, Norah. You&rsquo;ll beat
Penny Wise at his own game, if he doesn&rsquo;t watch
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Norah, and she laid her fingertips
gracefully back on her typewriter keys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />The Link</h2>
<p>It was the next afternoon that Penny Wise came
into my office. It was his first visit there, and
I gave him a hearty welcome. Norah looked
so eagerly expectant that I introduced him to her,
for I couldn&rsquo;t bear to disappoint the girl by ignoring
her.</p>
<p>Wise was delightfully cordial toward her, and
indeed Norah&rsquo;s winsome personality always made
people friendly.</p>
<p>I had tried to get in touch with the detective the
day before but he was out on various errands, and
I missed him here and there, nor could we get together
until he found this leisure.</p>
<p>I told him all I had learned from the police, but
part of it was already known to him. He was
greatly interested in the news which he had not
heard before, that there was somebody implicated,
who was called &ldquo;The Link.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one we want!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I suspected
some such person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man or woman?&rdquo; asked Norah, briefly, and
Wise glanced at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; she replied, and Penny Wise nodded
his head. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve no doubt &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; is a
woman, and a mighty important factor in the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;What does
she link?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom,&mdash;not what,&rdquo; said Wise, and he looked
very serious. &ldquo;Of course, you must realize, Brice,
there&rsquo;s a great big motive behind this Gately murder,
and there&rsquo;s also a big reason for Amory Manning&rsquo;s
disappearance. The two are connected,&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no doubt of that,&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t argue
Manning the murderer, of course. No, this Link
is a woman of parts,&mdash;a woman who is of highest
value to the principals in this crime, and who must
be found, and that at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she have to do with Mr. Gately?&rdquo; asked
Norah, her gray eyes burning with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know.&rdquo; Wise&rsquo;s hesitating answer
was by no means because of disinclination to admit
his ignorance, but because he was thinking deeply
himself. &ldquo;Look here, Brice, can&rsquo;t we go over
Gately&rsquo;s rooms now? I don&rsquo;t want to ask permission
of the police, but if the Trust Company people
would let us in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I responded, and I went at once to
the vice-president for the desired permission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I announced, returning with the
keys, &ldquo;come ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the beautiful rooms of the late
bank president.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Pennington Wise was impressed with their rich
and harmonious effects, and his quick eyes darted
here and there, taking in details. With marvelous
swiftness he went through the three rooms of the
suite nodding his head as he noted the special points
of which he had been told. In the third room,&mdash;the
Blue Room,&mdash;he glanced about, raised the map from
the wall, and dropped it back in place, opened the
door to the hall, and closed it again, and then turned
back to the middle room, the office of Amos Gately,
and apparently, to the detective&rsquo;s mind, the principal
place of interest.</p>
<p>He sat down in the fine big swivel-chair, whose
velvet cushioning deprived it of all look of an
ordinary desk-chair, and mused deeply as his eyes
fairly devoured the desk fittings. Nothing had been
disturbed, that I noticed, except that the telephone
had been set up in its right position, and also the
chair which I had found overturned was righted.</p>
<p>Wise fingered only a few things. He picked up
the penholder, a thick magnificent affair made of
gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a gift from his clerks,&rdquo; said I, smiling
at the ornate and ostentatious looking thing. &ldquo;All
the other gimcracks are in better taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pennington Wise opened the desk drawers.
There was little to see, for all financial papers had
been taken away by Mr. Gately&rsquo;s executors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a queer bunch,&rdquo; Wise observed, as he
picked up a packet of papers held together by a
rubber band. He sorted them out on the desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>They were sheets of paper of various styles, each
bearing the address or escutcheon of some big
city hotel. Many of the principal hostelries of New
York were represented among them. Each sheet
bore a date stamped on it with an ordinary rubber
dating-stamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Important, if true,&rdquo; commented Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what&rsquo;s true?&rdquo; asked Norah, bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My deductions,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;These letters,
if we can call them letters, doubtless were sent to
Mr. Gately at separate times and in separate envelopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; I informed him. &ldquo;One came the
morning after his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did! Which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t here. All the new mail went to his
lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get hold of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&mdash;do tell me what&rsquo;s the import of a blank
sheet of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t blank,&rdquo; and he pointed to the
stamped dates. &ldquo;They are very far from
blank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a date,&mdash;on a plain sheet of paper,&mdash;what
does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing&mdash;perhaps everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like Penny Wise to be cryptic, and I
gathered that the papers were really of value as
evidence. &ldquo;Has the writing been erased?&rdquo; I
hazarded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. No. I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; He
scrutinized more closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;nothing like that. The
message is all told on the surface, and he who runs
may read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read, &lsquo;The Waldorf-Astoria, December 7.&rsquo;&rdquo;
I scoffed. &ldquo;And is the reader greatly enlightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but soon,&rdquo; Wise murmured, as he kept
up his investigation. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;as the
actor hath it,&mdash;what have we here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was now scrutinizing the ends of two burnt
cigarettes, left on the ash-tray of the smoking-set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady has left her initials! How kind of
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hudson studied those and couldn&rsquo;t make
out any letters,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind Hudson! These very dainty and expensive
cigarettes belonged to a fair one, whose name
began with K and S,&mdash;or S and K. Be careful
how you touch it, but surely you can see that the
tops of the letters though scorched, show definitely
enough to know they must be K and S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are!&rdquo; cried Norah; &ldquo;I can see it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t that S be an O?&rdquo; I caviled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; and Wise shook his head. &ldquo;The two,
though both nearly burnt away, show for sure that
the letters are K and S. Here&rsquo;s a find! Does Miss
Raynor smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen
her do so,&mdash;and she doesn&rsquo;t seem that type. And
then,&mdash;the initials&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, she might have had some of her
friends&rsquo; cigarettes with her. I was only thinking it
must have been a pretty intimate caller who would
sit here and smoke with Mr. Gately&mdash;here are his
own cigar stubs you see and of course, Miss Raynor
came into my mind. Eliminating her we have,
maybe, the lady of the hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the powder-paper!&rdquo; cried Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they all seem to point to a very friendly
caller, who smoked, who took off her hat, and who
powdered her nose, all in this room, and all on the
day Mr. Gately was killed. For, of course, the
whole place was cleaned and put in order every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was the carriage check,&rdquo; I mused;
&ldquo;perhaps she left that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carriage check?&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a card like a piece of Swiss cheese,&mdash;you
know those perforated carriage-call checks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hudson took it. But he won&rsquo;t get anything
out of it, and you might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I must see it, anyway. Also, I want
to see Jenny,&mdash;the young stenographer who
was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get her here?&rdquo; offered Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Wise began, but I cut him short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go home,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I promised
Rivers I&rsquo;d see him this afternoon, and take him
on some errands. Suppose I go now, and you go
with me, Mr. Wise, and suppose Norah gets Jenny
and brings her round to my rooms. We can have
the interview there; Rivers may not come till later,
but I must be there to receive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Penny Wise and I went down to my pleasant
vine and figtree, and as we went, I told him about
Case Rivers.</p>
<p>He was interested at once, as he always was in
anything mysterious, and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
him. What a strange case! Can he be the missing
Manning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The two men are
totally dissimilar in looks and in build. Manning
is heavy,&mdash;almost stocky. Rivers is gaunt and lean.
Also, Manning is dark-haired and full-blooded,
while Rivers is pale and has very light hair. I tried
to make out a resemblance, but it can&rsquo;t be done.
However, Case Rivers is interesting on his own account;&rdquo;
and I told him the story of his journey
through the earth.</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Hallucination, of course,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but it might easily lead to the discovery of his
identity. That amnesic-aphasia business always fascinates
me. That is, if I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s the real
thing. For, you know, it&rsquo;s a fine opportunity to fake
loss of memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fake in this case, I&rsquo;m positive,&rdquo; I
hastened to assure him; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken a decided liking
to Rivers, and I mean to keep in touch with him,
for when he regains his memory I want to know
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pulled out of the river, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a tugboat picked him up, drowned and
frozen, it was supposed. He was taken to the
morgue, and bless you, if he didn&rsquo;t show signs of
life when he thawed out a little. So they went to
work on him and revived him and sent him over to
Bellevue where he became a celebrated case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so. No clothes or any identification?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a rag. Or rather only a few rags of underwear,&mdash;but
nothing that was the slightest clew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of his clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. He was found drifting, unconscious,
apparently dead, and entirely nude save
the fragments of underclothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fragments have been kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but they mean nothing. Just ordinary
material,&mdash;good,&mdash;but nothing individual about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was he picked up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but not far from the
morgue, I believe. It was the same day as the
Gately murder, that&rsquo;s why I remember the date. It
was a dreadfully cold snap, the river was full of ice
and it&rsquo;s a wonder he wasn&rsquo;t killed, as well as knocked
senseless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was he knocked senseless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but he was unconscious from cold
and exposure and very nearly frozen to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his memory now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is perfect in all respects, except he doesn&rsquo;t know
who he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fishy tale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you won&rsquo;t say so after you&rsquo;ve seen him.
When I say his memory is perfect, I mean regarding
what he has read or has studied. But it is his
personal recollections that have gone from him. He
has no remembrance of his home or his friends or
his own identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you deduce his previous occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. Perhaps you can. He can draw, and
he is well-read, that&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were at my rooms by that time, and going up,
we found Case Rivers already there awaiting us. I
lamented my lack of promptness, but he gracefully
waived my apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he smiled in his good-humored
way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been browsing among your books and
having the time of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I introduced the two men, and told Rivers that
Wise was the famous detective I had mentioned
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m downright glad to know you,&rdquo; Rivers said,
earnestly; &ldquo;if you can do a bit of deduction as to
who I am, I&rsquo;ll be under deepest obligation. I give
you myself as a clew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got a picture of Amory Manning?&rdquo; asked
Wise, abruptly.</p>
<p>I handed him a folded newspaper, whose front
page bore a cut of Manning, and the story of his
mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p>Wise studied the picture and compared it with
the man before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Totally unlike,&rdquo; he said, disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; laughed Rivers; &ldquo;I wish I could
step into that chap&rsquo;s shoes; but you see, I came from
far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about that trip of yours,&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know much to tell,&rdquo; returned Rivers;
&ldquo;but what I do know, I know positively, so I&rsquo;ll
warn you beforehand not to chuckle at me, for I
won&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rivers showed a determination that I liked. It
proved that I was right in ascribing a strong character
to him. He would stand chaffing as well as
anyone I knew, but not on the subject of his fall
through the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when or where I started on my
memorable journey, but I distinctly remember my
long, dark fall straight down through the earth.
Now it would seem impossible, but I can aver that
I entered in some very cold, arctic sort of country,
and I came on down feet first, till I made exit
in New York. I was found, but how I got into the
river, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were clothed when you started?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say that I assume I was. I&rsquo;m a
normal, decent sort of man, and I can&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
consciously set out on a trip of any sort undressed!
But I&rsquo;ve no doubt my swashing around in the ice-filled
river did for my clothes. Probably, as related
by the Ancient Mariner, &lsquo;the ice was here, the ice
was there, the ice was all around: it cracked and
growled and&mdash;something or other&mdash;and howled,
like noises in a swound.&rsquo; You see, I still know my
&lsquo;Familiar Quotations&rsquo; by heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer phase,&rdquo; and Wise shook his
head. &ldquo;It may be you are a poet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t poetized any since my recrudescence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s another queer thing,&rdquo; pursued the
detective. &ldquo;Most victims of aphasia can&rsquo;t remember
words. You are exceptionally fluent and seem
to have a wide vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit it all,&rdquo; and Rivers looked a little weary,
as if he were tired of speculating on his own case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to change the subject, how are you progressing,
Mr. Wise, with your present work? How
goes the stalking of the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got him yet, Mr. Rivers, but we&rsquo;ve
made a good start. You know the details?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the newspaper accounts, and such additional
information as Mr. Brice has given me. I&rsquo;m
greatly interested,&mdash;for,&mdash;tell it not to Gath detectives,&mdash;I
fancy I&rsquo;ve a bent toward sleuthing myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Pennington Wise smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not alone in
that,&rdquo; he said, chaffingly, but so good-naturedly that
Rivers took no offense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s your reflected light that makes
everybody who talks with you feel that way,&rdquo; he
came back. &ldquo;Well, if you get up a stump, lean on
me, Grandpa,&mdash;I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then we all three discussed the case, in all
its phases, and though Rivers said nothing of great
importance, he showed such an intellectual grasp of
it all, and responded so intelligently to Wise&rsquo;s
theories and opinions that the two soon became
most friendly.</p>
<p>The announcement of the rewards stirred Rivers
to enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;both of &rsquo;em!
With all due respect to you, Mr. Wise, I&rsquo;m going
to cut under and win out! Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn
you, and hereafter all you say will be used against
you! If there&rsquo;s one thing I need more than another
it&rsquo;s ten thousand dollars,&mdash;I could even do with
twenty! So, here goes for Rivers, the swiftsure
detective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a bit offended, Penny Wise laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, my boy,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a bargain;
you work with me, and I&rsquo;ll work with you. If
we get either Manning or the murderer or both, then
either or both rewards shall be yours. I&rsquo;ll be content
with what else I can get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; and Case Rivers was jubilant. &ldquo;Perhaps
Manning is the murderer,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. Manning is
in love with Miss Raynor, and he wouldn&rsquo;t queer
his cause by killing her guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Guardy didn&rsquo;t approve of Suitor Manning,&rdquo;
Rivers said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I know Manning and you don&rsquo;t,&mdash;well,
that is, I know him only slightly. But I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;s not the man to shoot a financial magnate
and a first-class citizen just because he frowned on
his suit. Try again, Rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right: what you say goes. But I&rsquo;m just
starting in, you know. And, by the way, I&rsquo;m to get
a job of some sort today&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me inquiringly, but Wise answered.
&ldquo;Wait a bit, Rivers, as to that. If you&rsquo;ll agree, I&rsquo;ll
grubstake you for a fortnight or so, and you can
help me. Really, I mean it, for as a stranger you
can go to places, and see people, where I can&rsquo;t show
my familiar face. Then, when you get the two rewards
you can repay me my investment in you.
And if you fail to nail the ten thousand, I&rsquo;ll take
your note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you!&rdquo; said Rivers, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Penny Wise!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>A tap at the door announced Norah, and with her
came Jenny Boyd. Nor was Jenny dragged unwillingly,&mdash;she
seemed eager to enter,&mdash;but her absurd
little painted face wore a look of stubbornness
and her red lips were shut in a determined
pout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny knows who &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; is, and she won&rsquo;t
tell,&rdquo; Norah declared, as a first bit of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she will,&rdquo; and Penny Wise winked at
the girl. He really gave a very knowing wink, as
who should say: &ldquo;We understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they had never met before, I watched to see
just how Jenny would take it, and to my surprise
she looked decidedly frightened.</p>
<p>Wise saw this too,&mdash;doubtless he brought about
the effect purposely,&mdash;but in a moment Jenny regained
her poise and was her saucy self again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and so I
don&rsquo;t want to get nobody into trouble by suspicioning
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get anybody into trouble,&rdquo; Wise assured
her, &ldquo;unless she has made the trouble for
herself. Let&rsquo;s play a game, Jenny,&mdash;let&rsquo;s talk in
riddles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny eyed him curiously, and then, as he smiled
infectiously, she did, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; went on Wise, &ldquo;this is the game. I
don&rsquo;t know, of course, whom you have in mind, and
you don&rsquo;t know whom I have in mind, so we&rsquo;ll play
the game this way: I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;I know she is a clever
woman.&rsquo; Now you make a truthful statement about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enthralled by his manner, Jenny said, almost involuntarily,
&ldquo;I know she is a wrong one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; said Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Jenny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she is black-haired and dresses well
and owns a scarab hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, too,&rdquo; and Jenny was breathless
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that won&rsquo;t do. You must know something
different from my know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know she&rsquo;s a friend of Mr. Rodman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of Mr. Gately,&rdquo; added Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir, I don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo; Jenny&rsquo;s surprise
was unfeigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know she&rsquo;s a telegraph girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: and I know she has more money to spend
than she gets for a salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&mdash;that way. But she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She smokes cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she does. Oh, I think that&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your turn. You know she&rsquo;s &lsquo;The
Link&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s been called that, but it isn&rsquo;t a regular
nickname, and I don&rsquo;t know what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her work, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s in the company&rsquo;s office,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here
Jenny whispered the address to Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Keep it dark.
No use in telling all these people!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>He turned to my telephone, then said: &ldquo;No,
Brice, you do it. Call Headquarters and tell the
Chief to arrest,&mdash;what&rsquo;s her name, Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say, sir.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s caution was
returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say now, then,&rdquo; commanded Wise. &ldquo;I know,
anyway. It begins with S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her first name,&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the last name with K. You see I know!
So, out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie Kent,&rdquo; whispered Jenny, her nerves beginning
to go to pieces at realizaton of what she
had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Sadie Kent. Go ahead, Brice.
Fix it all up,&mdash;and go to the telegraph office yourself.
Meet the officers there. Scoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scooted. The strong arm of the law works
swiftly when it wills to do so. Within half an
hour Sadie Kent was arrested at her key in the telegraph
office on charge of stealing confidential
telegrams sent by officials in Washington to munition
plants and steamship companies and delivering
them to persons who she knew would transmit them
to the German Foreign Office.</p>
<p>When approached, the girl,&mdash;the woman rather,&mdash;put
up a bold bluff, but it was of no avail. She was
taken into custody, and all her appeals for mercy
denied. All but one. She begged so hard to be
allowed to telephone to her mother that Hudson,
who was present, softened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, my lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have it
done for you. Mr. Brice, now, maybe he&rsquo;ll
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you would be so kind,&rdquo; and the beautiful
brunette, for she was that, gave me a grateful look.
&ldquo;Just call 83649 Greenwich Square, and ask for
Mrs. Kent. Then tell her, please, that&mdash;that I won&rsquo;t
be home tonight. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice broke and she sobbed softly in her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>They took her away, to be detained pending developments.
I made the call and gave the message
exactly as she had asked me. A pleasant voice responded,
saying the speaker was Mrs. Kent, and she
thanked me for sending word.</p>
<p>I hurried back to my rooms. Wise and Rivers
were still there but Norah and Jenny had left. I
had no sooner got my coat off than Zizi came flying
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everybody,&rdquo; she cried, in a whirl of excitement,
&ldquo;Olive&rsquo;s gone! She&rsquo;s kidnaped or abducted or
something. A telephone message came and she flew
off, telling nobody but Mrs. Vail, and telling her
not to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she gone?&rdquo; I cried, flinging back into
my coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. I only got it out of Mrs.
Vail this minute, and then only by threatening
her with all sorts of horrors if she didn&rsquo;t tell me.
She doesn&rsquo;t know where Olive&rsquo;s gone,&mdash;nobody
knows,&mdash;but whoever telephoned said he had Amory
Manning with him, just for a few moments and for
her to come at once if she wanted to see him. A
car would come for her at four o&rsquo;clock, exactly,
and she was to get in and ask no questions. And
she did&mdash;and she told Mrs. Vail that as soon as she
got to Mr. Manning she would telephone back,&mdash;in
about fifteen minutes. And now it&rsquo;s over an hour!
and no word from her! That stupid old woman
just walks up and down and wrings her hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she would! Which way shall we
look, Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; and for once the
resourceful detective was absolutely at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny Wise,&rdquo; and Zizi burst into tears,
&ldquo;if <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t know what to do, nobody does!
Olive will be killed or held for ransom or some
dreadful thing! What <i>can</i> we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dull silence that fell on us all proved
that no one present was able to offer any suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />Olive&rsquo;s Adventure</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a handkerchief, somebody!&rdquo; commanded
Zizi, and not without reason, for
her own tiny wisp of cambric was nothing
but a wet ball, which she was futilely dabbing into
her big black eyes.</p>
<p>I hurried into my bedroom and hastily grabbed
a fresh handkerchief from a drawer, which I
brought to the excited girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said, as she grasped it and plied
it diligently; &ldquo;now, men, we must get busy! It&rsquo;s
after five o&rsquo;clock, Olive went away before four,&mdash;anything
may have happened to her&mdash;we <i>must</i>
rescue her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; exclaimed Case Rivers, showing
more energy than I knew he possessed. &ldquo;What
about &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; Mr. Brice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quickly as I could, I detailed what had happened
at the telegraph office, where Sadie Kent had
been taken into custody by Hudson&rsquo;s men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she go quietly?&rdquo; asked Penny Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not!&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;she put up a fearful
fight, tore up a lot of papers from a desk
drawer, and lit into the policemen like a tiger cat!
She tried to bite Hudson, and yet, he was the one
who kind-heartedly let her telephone to her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Rivers, &ldquo;he let her do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it myself, really,&rdquo; I said; and I told how
Sadie had begged for the privilege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Rivers said, positively.
&ldquo;That telephone message was not to her mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I called her up,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;and she said
she was Mrs. Kent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; and Rivers shook his head; &ldquo;but,
don&rsquo;t you see, that was a code call,&mdash;a warning.
The person who received it, mother or grandmother,
caught on to the state of things and set machinery
in motion that resulted in the kidnaping of Miss
Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I asked, blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge, probably, but there may be other villainies
afoot. Am I right, Mr. Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and mighty quick-witted. Then the next
step is to go to the &lsquo;mother&rsquo;s&rsquo; house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we can trace it. It may be a call within
a call; I mean, the number Mr. Brice got may be
merely a go-between&mdash;a link&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it, anyway,&rdquo; implored Zizi; &ldquo;every minute
is precious. I&rsquo;m so afraid for Miss Olive. You
know, she&rsquo;s spunky,&mdash;she won&rsquo;t submit easily to
restraint, and you don&rsquo;t know what they may do
to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Information first,&rdquo; directed Wise, as I
started for the telephone. &ldquo;Find the address of the
number you called. You remember it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course.&rdquo; And in a few moments I
learned that the house was down in Washington
Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a taxi,&rdquo; said Zizi, already putting on her
long black cape, which swirled round the slender
figure as she flung one end over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She flew to a mirror, and was dabbing her
straight little nose with a powder-puff as she talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go down there, and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll
have to look any further. Miss Olive is there,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
dead sure! Held by the enemy! But she&rsquo;s game,
and I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll be too late, if we hustle
like a house afire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, with the greatest speed consistent with
safety, we taxied down to the house in Washington
Square.</p>
<p>The Kent apartment was on the third floor, and
as Zizi dashed up the stairs, not waiting for the
elevator, we three men followed her.</p>
<p>Zizi&rsquo;s ring at the bell brought a middle-aged
woman to the door, who looked at us rather
blankly.</p>
<p>I was about to speak, when Zizi, insinuating her
small self through the partly opened door, said
softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a message from &lsquo;The Link.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It acted like magic, and the woman&rsquo;s face changed
to an expression of welcome and serious anxiety, as
we all went in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>It was rather a pretentious apartment, with fine
furnishings in ornate taste. We saw no one save
the woman who admitted us, and heard no sound
from other rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expected it?&rdquo; and Zizi&rsquo;s air of secret
understanding was perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expected what?&rdquo; said Mrs. Kent, sharply, for
she was apparently on her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie&rsquo;s arrest,&rdquo; and Zizi&rsquo;s black eyes narrowed
as she looked keenly at the other.</p>
<p>But the woman was not to be trapped. She
glanced at us each in turn, and seemed to conclude
we were not friendly visitors for all Zizi&rsquo;s pretense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of any arrest,&rdquo; she said, evenly;
&ldquo;I think you have mistaken the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; and Penny Wise looked at her
sternly. &ldquo;Your bluff won&rsquo;t go, madam,&mdash;Sadie,
&lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; is arrested, and the game is up. Will
you answer questions or will you wait until you,
too, are arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; she mumbled, but her
voice trembled, and her nerve was deserting her.
Inadvertently she glanced toward the closed door of
the next room, and Zizi&rsquo;s quick eyes followed the
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Raynor in there?&rdquo; she flung out so
quickly that Mrs. Kent gasped. But she recovered
her poise at once and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you
mean,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know any Miss Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tut, tut!&rdquo; and Zizi grinned at her; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
tell naughty stories! Why, I hear Miss Raynor&rsquo;s
voice!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t at all, but as she listened, with her
head cocked on one side, like a saucy bird, Mrs.
Kent&rsquo;s face showed fear, and she listened also.</p>
<p>A muffled scream was heard,&mdash;not loud, but
clearly a cry for help.</p>
<p>Without further parley, Rivers made a dash for
the door and though it was locked, he smashed into
the rather flimsy panel and the old hinges gave way.</p>
<p>There, in the adjoining room was Olive Raynor,
a handkerchief tied across her mouth and her angry
eyes flashing with rage.</p>
<p>Holding her arm was George Rodman, who was
evidently trying to intimidate her, but without
complete success.</p>
<p>Zizi flew to Olive&rsquo;s side, and snatched off the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>Rodman was perfectly cool. &ldquo;Let that lady
alone,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she is my affianced wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affianced grandmother!&rdquo; retorted Zizi. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t put that over, Mr. Rodman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; Olive said, looking from me to
Penny Wise and back again. Her glance fell on
Rivers, but returned to me, as her face assumed a
look of agony.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand, as she must know
that with us all there her danger was past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you his betrothed?&rdquo; Case Rivers said,
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Olive replied, in an indignant tone;
&ldquo;never!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Rivers seemed about to remove
Rodman&rsquo;s hand from Olive&rsquo;s arm by force, but
Rodman himself spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, please,&rdquo; he said, quietly, and
bending over, he whispered in Olive&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>She turned deathly white, her lips quivered, and
she seemed about to fall. Whatever the brief words
were, they wrought a marvelous change in the girl&rsquo;s
attitude. She lost her air of defiant wrath, and
seemed a helpless, hopeless victim of the man who
held her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you engaged to me?&rdquo; Rodman said, looking
at Olive, with a threatening scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she managed to whisper, but so agonized
was her face that it was palpable she spoke under
coercion.</p>
<p>I was uncertain what to do; Wise, too, looked
nonplussed, but Rivers, though a stranger to Olive,
seemed imbued with an irresistible chivalry, and
drawing nearer to her, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that man forcing you to say that against
your will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodman&rsquo;s grip tightened on Olive&rsquo;s arm, and his
glowering face looked sternly into hers. She made
no reply in words, but her piteous glance told all
too clearly that Rivers&rsquo; assumption was correct.</p>
<p>And yet, what could we do? Olive had assented
to Rodman&rsquo;s assertion, and we could scarcely demand
a girl from her fianc&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Zizi mastered the situation by saying, triumphantly:
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;The Link!&rsquo; She&rsquo;s under
arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Olive, and then, dropping her
arm, Rodman whirled toward her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;your secret is out! Unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
made a gesture as if to put his arm
round her.</p>
<p>With a cry of revulsion, Olive shrank from him,
and her face showed that she preferred his threatening
attitude to his endearing one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let that lady alone, unless she desires your
attentions,&rdquo; said Rivers, his innate desire to protect
a woman in distress showing in his repressed eagerness
to get at Rodman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mind your own business!&rdquo; shouted Rodman,
angrily, as he put out his arm and drew Olive
to him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine, now, aren&rsquo;t you, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disgust on the girl&rsquo;s face, and the shrinking
of her form as she tried to draw away from the
leering face so near hers was too much for Rivers.
He assumed a threatening attitude, and said, &ldquo;You
take your hands off that lady! She doesn&rsquo;t
want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In defiance, Rodman drew Olive nearer, and
raising her bowed head was about to kiss her angry,
beautiful face, when she uttered a despairing
scream.</p>
<p>That was the match in the powder-keg!</p>
<p>Unable to hold back longer, Rivers sprang forward
and wrenched Olive from Rodman&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>With a snarl, Rodman lunged at Rivers, who
deftly stopped him with an uppercut. Rodman
came back with a smashing facer, and Rivers replied
in kind.</p>
<p>Zizi, who had flown to Olive&rsquo;s side, and was
tenderly soothing her, watched the two men, breathlessly.
Something savage in her nature responded
to the combat, and she flushed and paled alternately
as one or the other of the angry men seemed to
have the upper hand.</p>
<p>Olive hid her face in her hands, not wanting to
look, but Zizi was with the fight, heart and
soul.</p>
<p>It was give and take, with such rapidity that I
trembled for Rivers&rsquo; safety. Rodman was a formidable
antagonist, and far heavier than the gaunt
man who met and returned his blows.</p>
<p>But Rivers was skilled, and made up in technique
what he lacked in strength.</p>
<p>So desperate was the struggle, so blindly furious
the two men, that Pennington Wise and I were fearful
of results. With a simultaneous impulse we
made a dash to separate the combatants, but were
obliged to get back quickly to save ourselves from
the rain of blows.</p>
<p>Never had I seen such a wild, unbridled fight
compressed into such a short time, and I wondered
what Rivers had been in a fighting way before he
lost his identity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Fighting and boxing had never been favorite
forms of entertainment with me, but this contest
absorbed me. It was primitive, instinctive,&mdash;the
rage of Rodman pitted against the angry indignation
of Rivers.</p>
<p>I had not thought of the latter as a weakling, but
neither had I looked upon him as a strong man, and
I should have judged that in a bout with Rodman
he would have gone under.</p>
<p>But not so; his lean, gaunt frame was full of
latent strength, his bony fists full of dexterity.</p>
<p>He rushed in, fell back, sidestepped, with the
dazzling quickness of a trained fighter. He showed
knowledge and skill that amazed me.</p>
<p>Rodman, too, fought for all he was worth, but
he impressed me as being not an experienced
fighter,&mdash;and not a fair one.</p>
<p>Wise, too, was watching Rivers with wonder and
admiration, and he also kept his alert gaze on
Rodman.</p>
<p>Fascinated, we watched as Rodman clinched, and
Rivers with a smile, almost of contempt, threw
him off. Then Rodman, bellowing like an angry
bull, made a head-on rush for Rivers, who neatly
sidestepped, letting his furious antagonist have it
on the side of his head.</p>
<p>Even this didn&rsquo;t knock any sense into Rodman,
and he was about to plunge again, when Wise, seeing
a chance, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Brice!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Springing in, I hooked my arm around Rivers&rsquo;
neck, and yanked him away from Rodman, now
struggling, half-spent, in Wise&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up, Rivers!&rdquo; I cried, sternly; &ldquo;what do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at me, not sensing what I said, and
then, Rodman, breaking loose, came at him madly,
Rivers slithered out of my clutch and caught the
other a smashing blow on the ear. This, landing
just as Rodman was off his balance from his break-away
from Wise, spun him around and sent him
down with a crash which knocked all the fight out
of him, and he made but a half-hearted attempt to
rise.</p>
<p>Satisfied, Rivers turned to me, and then, with a
half-apologetic glance at Olive, murmured: &ldquo;Sorry!
Couldn&rsquo;t help it, Miss Raynor. Brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last was addressed to his fallen foe, and was
met by a vindictive glance, but no other retort.</p>
<p>Rodman, however, was pulling himself together
and we were of one mind as to our next procedure,
which was to get Olive Raynor away from that
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it,&rdquo; Wise decreed; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good one,
Mr. Rivers! My hat&rsquo;s off to you. Now, if you&rsquo;re
fit, and you look it, will you and Mr. Brice take
Miss Raynor home, and I&rsquo;ll stay here and clear up
this little disturbance. Hop along with them, Ziz;
I&rsquo;ll join you all at the house as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>The faithful taxi was waiting, and Rivers and I
put the two girls in, and followed them. Rivers
was very quiet and seemed preoccupied. He looked
not at all like a conqueror, and I guessed that the
fight had stirred some chord of remembrance, and
he was now struggling with his lost memory. In
silence we went most of the way home.</p>
<p>Before we reached the house, however, he shook
off his reverie with an impatient gesture that said,
as clearly as words could have done, that he had
failed to catch the elusive thread that bound him
to the past and that he had returned to the
present.</p>
<p>Olive saw it, too, and putting out her hand, said,
frankly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you deep gratitude, Mr. Rivers. I suppose
I was in no real danger, with you men there,
but I must confess I was glad to have that wretch
punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lovely face glowed with righteous indignation,
and Zizi&rsquo;s pert little countenance showed deep
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave it to him, good and plenty, Mr.
Rivers,&rdquo; she fairly crowed; &ldquo;it was a treat to see
you put it all over him! Now, you&rsquo;ve knocked him
out physically, Penny Wise will mop up the floor
with him mentally and morally! What did he do
to you, Miss Olive? Why did he make you say
you were his girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of agony returned to Olive&rsquo;s face, as if
she had just recollected what the man had said to
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He threatened me,&rdquo; she said, slowly; &ldquo;with an
awful threat! I can&rsquo;t think about it! Oh, I don&rsquo;t
know what to do! I can&rsquo;t tell it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell it to
anybody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you get home,&rdquo; I counseled her, and
Rivers added, &ldquo;And wait till Mr. Wise comes. He&rsquo;s
the man you must tell, and he will advise you. But,
I say, we&rsquo;re getting at things, eh, Brice? &lsquo;The
Link&rsquo; under arrest, Wise onto Rodman, and he
won&rsquo;t let go of him, either, and Miss Raynor safe,&mdash;whew!
I feel as if we should just forge ahead
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will!&rdquo; declared Zizi, her little face
glowing with anticipation. &ldquo;Never you mind. Miss
Olive, dear; whatever that man threatened, Penny
Wise will look after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Olive, and then stopped, for
we had reached her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling child,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Vail, as
we went in, &ldquo;where have you been? I&rsquo;ve been
nearly crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think we all felt a sudden twinge of shame, for
none of us had thought to relieve the poor lady&rsquo;s
suspense as to Olive&rsquo;s fate! We ought to have
telephoned, at least. But she was now smiling and
happy at the safe return of her charge and eager to
know all the details of the adventure.</p>
<p>Both Olive and Zizi went off with Mrs. Vail, who
was chattering volubly, and I was left alone with
Rivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fight,&mdash;on which let me congratulate you,&mdash;stirred
some old memory?&rdquo; I said, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few moments, yes;&rdquo; he returned, looking
deeply thoughtful. &ldquo;But it was both vague and
evanescent, I couldn&rsquo;t nail it. Oh!&rdquo; and he made
an impatient gesture, &ldquo;it is maddening! I seem
just on the edge of complete recollection,&mdash;and,
then,&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone again, and my mind is a positive
blank regarding it. But, it&rsquo;s no use worrying,
Brice,&rdquo; and he spoke cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will
come, some day. Until then I shall be Case Rivers,
and if I die under the name, I&rsquo;ll try, at least, not
to disgrace it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t disgrace it today,&rdquo; I said, heartily.
&ldquo;You put up a first-class fight, and in a righteous
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it to see Miss Raynor bullied
by that brute,&rdquo; he returned, simply, &ldquo;and then, too,
I felt a natural antagonism toward him on my own
account. No,&rdquo; as I started to speak, &ldquo;I know what
you&rsquo;re going to say, and I don&rsquo;t think I knew him
before I lost my memory. Maybe I did, but it
wasn&rsquo;t that that startled me to thinking back. It
was something else,&mdash;some other impression, that
made me have a fraction of a reminiscence of something,&mdash;oh,
I don&rsquo;t know what, but I&rsquo;m going to
take it as an omen of future good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />Where is Manning?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to stay for dinner,&rdquo; a voice said,
speaking from the shadows at the other end
of the long room.</p>
<p>As I looked toward it, Zizi&rsquo;s little white face
gleamed between the porti&egrave;res, and in another
moment she slid through and was at my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Raynor says so, and Mrs. Vail adds her
invitation. They&rsquo;re going to keep Penny Wise
when he returns, and Miss Raynor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Raynor wants to thank Mr. Rivers for his
good work,&rdquo; and Olive herself followed in Zizi&rsquo;s
footsteps. She was smiling now, but her lips were
tremulous and her eyes showed unshed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to thank me for,&rdquo; returned Case
Rivers, quickly, &ldquo;on the contrary, I want to apologize
for such an exhibition of wrath before a lady.
But I confess I lost all self-control when I saw that
brute intimidating you. If you absolve me of offense,
I am thoroughly glad I did him up! And
you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; and Olive&rsquo;s frank gaze was sincere
but sad, too. &ldquo;I was terribly frightened,&mdash;and,&mdash;I
am still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; cried Rivers, abruptly, and then added,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve no right to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; Olive assured him, &ldquo;but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
no right to tell you. Mr. Rodman holds a threat
over my head, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Wise arrived, and Mrs. Vail came into
the room with him.</p>
<p>Olive welcomed him gladly, and then, as dinner
was announced, we all went to the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No discussion of our momentous affairs while
we eat,&rdquo; Wise commanded, and so we enjoyed the
occasion as if it were a social affair.</p>
<p>The conversation was interesting, for Pennington
Wise was a well-informed man and a good <i>raconteur</i>;
Rivers proved to be most entertaining and
clever at repartee; and though Olive was very quiet,
Mrs. Vail kept up an amusing chatter, and Zizi was
her own elfin self and flung out bits of her odd talk
at intervals.</p>
<p class="tb">We returned to the big library for coffee, and
then, almost abruptly, Wise began to question Olive
as to her adventure that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rivers was quite right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in assuming
the telephone call sent by Sadie Kent to her
&lsquo;mother&rsquo; was a trick. Mighty clever of you,&rdquo; he
turned to Rivers, &ldquo;and it led to the arrest of
Rodman. The woman called Mrs. Kent is not
Sadie&rsquo;s mother, but a companion in crime. For
Sadie, &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; is a criminal and a deep one!
But first, Miss Raynor, let us have your story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I answered the telephone call,&rdquo; Olive
began, &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s voice said, rather brusquely, &lsquo;We
have Amory Manning here. If you want to see him,
come here at once.&rsquo; I said,&mdash;of course, I was terribly
excited,&mdash;&lsquo;Where are you? who are you?&rsquo;
The voice replied, &lsquo;Never mind all that. You have
to make quick decision. If you want to see Manning,
a taxi will call for you in five minutes. Tell
nobody, or you will queer the whole game. Do you
consent?&rsquo; I may not give his exact words, but
that was his general meaning. I had to think
quickly; I <i>did</i> want to see Mr. Manning, and I
feared no harm. So I said I agreed to all the stipulations,
I would tell no one, and I would go in the
taxicab that would come for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Vail, who liked
to feel her importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Olive, &ldquo;I felt I must leave some
word, for I had an uneasy feeling that all was not
right. If Amory Manning was there, why didn&rsquo;t
he telephone himself? But, I reasoned, he might
be, well&mdash;in fact, I thought he was,&mdash;held for
ransom, and in that case I was ready and willing
to pay it. So, I said nothing to Zizi, for I knew
she would tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Yes!&rdquo; came from Zizi&rsquo;s corner, where
she sat on a low ottoman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so, I went alone. The taxi was at the curb
when I left this house. I got in, and was taken to
the house in Washington Square. I felt no fear
until, after Mrs. Kent admitted me, she showed me
into a room where I found myself confronted by
Mr. Rodman. Mrs. Kent remained with me, but I
saw at once she was not friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is Mr. Manning?&rsquo; I asked. Mr. Rodman
only laughed rudely and said he hadn&rsquo;t the
slightest idea. And then I knew it was all a trap,&mdash;but
I didn&rsquo;t know <i>why</i> I was tricked there. And
then,&rdquo; Olive paused, and a deep blush came over
her face, but she shook her head and went bravely
on, &ldquo;then he tried to make love to me. I appealed
to Mrs. Kent, but she only laughed scornfully at my
distress. He said if I would marry him he would
protect me from all suspicion of being implicated
in&mdash;in the death of my guardian! Of course, that
didn&rsquo;t scare me, and I told him I wasn&rsquo;t suspected
now, by anybody. Then he dropped that line of
argument and told me if I didn&rsquo;t marry him,&mdash;he
would&mdash;oh, that part I can&rsquo;t tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackmail!&rdquo; said Wise, looking at her intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and it was an awful threat!
Then, he saw I was indignant and not to be intimidated&mdash;oh,
I pretended to be much more courageous
than I really was,&mdash;and he began to talk more
politely and very seriously. He said, if I would
call off Mr. Wise and make no further effort to
run down my uncle&rsquo;s murderer, he would send
me home safely, and molest me no further. I
wouldn&rsquo;t agree to this; and then he grew ugly again,
and lost his temper, and&mdash;oh, he talked dreadfully!&rdquo;
Olive shuddered at the recollection, and her lips
quivered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>With quick sympathy, Zizi moved noiselessly
from her place, and, kneeling at Olive&rsquo;s side, took
her hand. With a grateful glance at the comforting
little fingers caressing her own, Olive went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stormed and he threatened me, and that
Kent woman joined in and said terrible things!
And I was so frightened I couldn&rsquo;t pretend I wasn&rsquo;t
any longer,&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do! And
then the bell rang, and Mrs. Kent went to the door,
and as I looked hopeful,&mdash;I suppose, for I welcomed
the thought of anybody&rsquo;s coming,&mdash;Mr. Rodman
threw a handkerchief around my mouth and tied it
behind my head. &lsquo;There, my lady,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
won&rsquo;t scream for help quite as quickly as you
planned to!&rsquo; And I couldn&rsquo;t make a sound! Then,
when I heard familiar voices,&mdash;Zizi&rsquo;s and Mr.
Wise&rsquo;s, I knew I <i>must</i> make myself heard, and with
a desperate effort, I got out a groan or wail for
help, though that awful man stood over me with
his hand raised to strike me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Vail, putting
her arm round Olive, &ldquo;it was fearful! Why,
once I heard of a case like that&mdash;no, I read it in a
book,&mdash;and the girl fainted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t faint, but I almost collapsed from
sheer fright lest I couldn&rsquo;t make a loud enough
sound to be heard by you people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we were coming!&rdquo; said Zizi, &ldquo;I saw by the
old hen&rsquo;s face she had you boxed up in there, and
I was going to do some ground and lofty yelling
myself, if Mr. Rivers hadn&rsquo;t smashed in the door
just as he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hold back,&rdquo; said Rivers, &ldquo;I gave way
to a blind impulse,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, too,&rdquo; and Olive gave him a grateful
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; cried Zizi, &ldquo;he made you say you
were engaged to him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Olive paled as with fear. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
tell about that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you weren&rsquo;t, and then he whispered to
you, and then you said you were,&rdquo; went on Zizi,
remorselessly reviewing the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&mdash;but&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t ask me! Perhaps,
I&rsquo;ll tell&mdash;later,&mdash;if I have to,&mdash;but&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive&rsquo;s head drooped on Zizi&rsquo;s shoulder, and the
eerie little voice said, &ldquo;There, there,&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk
any more now, Miss Olive, dear. Penny Wise, you
carry on the conversation from this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Wise, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell my story.
George Rodman is in the hands of the police, but
I doubt very much if they can prove anything on
him. He&rsquo;s a sly proposition, and covers his tracks
mighty well. Moreover, as to the murder of Mr.
Gately, Rodman has a perfect alibi.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your First Lessons in Sleuthing always say,
&lsquo;distrust the perfect alibi,&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured Zizi, without
looking up from her occupation of smoothing
Olive&rsquo;s softly banded hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;manufactured ones. But in this case
there seems to be no question. A Federal detective,
who has had his eye on Rodman for some time, was
in Rodman&rsquo;s office at the very time Mr. Gately was
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Rodman went down on the same
elevator I did, soon after the shooting,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than half an hour. And Rodman got on at
the seventh floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, the Federal Office man knows
that. They went down together from the tenth,&mdash;Rodman&rsquo;s
floor,&mdash;to the seventh, and then after they
looked after something there, Rodman went on
down alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said, for I knew that Wise and
the Federal Detective were not being hoodwinked
by any George Rodman!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the situation,&rdquo; Wise went on;
&ldquo;Sadie Kent is a German telegraph spy. She is
called &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; because she has been an important
link in the German spy system. A trusted employee
and an expert operator of long experience,
she has stolen information from hundreds of telegrams
and turned it over to a man who transmitted
it to Berlin by a secret avenue of communication.
A telegram has been sent to Washington asking for
a presidential warrant to hold her until the case can
be investigated. She is also one large and emphatic
wildcat! She bites and scratches with feline
ferocity, and is under strong and careful restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is the one,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;whose identity
we learned from Jenny&mdash;and,&mdash;oh, yes, whose identity
you guessed, Mr. Wise, from some cigarette
stubs, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; Wise interrupted me, shortly, &ldquo;we
must get the truth from her by quizzing, not by
clews. We&rsquo;ve arrested her, now, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive stirred uneasily, and Zizi, after a quick, intelligent
glance at Wise, which he answered by a
nod, rose to her feet, and urged Olive to rise and
go with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all in, Miss Olive,&rdquo; she said, gently,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to take you off to sleepy-by. Tell
the nice gentlemen good-night, and come along with
your Zizi-zoo. Upsy-diddy, now,&rdquo; and smilingly,
Zizi persuaded Olive to go with her. &ldquo;You come,
too, Mrs. Vail,&rdquo; Zizi added, because, I noticed, of
an almost imperceptible nod from Wise in the elder
lady&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;We just simpully can&rsquo;t get along
without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pleased at the flattering necessity for her presence,
Mrs. Vail went from the room with the two
girls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; she called out to us, as she
left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Wise, decidedly, after the
sound of footsteps died away, &ldquo;Zizi&rsquo;ll look out for
that. Now, Brice, I&rsquo;ve important new information.
I didn&rsquo;t want to divulge it before Miss Raynor, tonight,
for she has had about all she can bear today.
But it begins to look as if Sadie Kent sold her stolen
telegrams to Rodman, and he&mdash;can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, blankly, and Rivers said,
&ldquo;Tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe he turned them over to Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gately! Amos Gately mixed up in spy business!
Man, you&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy does it, then! Haven&rsquo;t we positive proof
that Sadie Kent was in Gately&rsquo;s office the day he was
killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I said, wonderingly. &ldquo;Did she kill
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no! But didn&rsquo;t I size her up from the
hatpin? and didn&rsquo;t your girl trace the powder-paper?
and didn&rsquo;t we see cigarette stubs with the S.K.
monogram,&mdash;in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s private office,&mdash;and
his own cigar stubs there, too, as if she had been
there in intimate chat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about the powder-paper?&rdquo; I cried,
impressed by the realization of Norah&rsquo;s hand in the
discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we know, at least, that she has bought
them from that shop. You see, she has lots of
money beside her salary from the telegraph company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said Rivers, &ldquo;if she&rsquo;s selling Government
secrets!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, after the whole disclosure began
to sink into my brain, &ldquo;if Sadie Kent sat around
in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office, smoking and chatting, with
her hat off, and her powder-papers in evidence, she
was pretty friendly with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she was,&rdquo; and Wise looked grave.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I dread to tell Miss Raynor. For it
implicates Amos Gately in some way; either he is
mixed up in the spy racket,&mdash;or&mdash;Miss Kent was
his friend&mdash;socially!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s say that
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear man, unpleasant though it be to
assume an intimacy between the bank president and
the handsome telegraph girl,&mdash;yet, isn&rsquo;t that preferable,&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To brand him with the shameful suspicion of
receiving spy secrets!&rdquo; Rivers completed the sentence.
&ldquo;Yes, it is! The most disgraceful revelations
of a liaison would be as nothing compared
with the ignominy of spy work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; I hastened to explain myself,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t connect either disgrace with Amos
Gately! You didn&rsquo;t know him, Wise, and you,
Rivers, didn&rsquo;t either. Nor did I know him personally,&mdash;but
I did know,&mdash;and do know, that no
breath of suspicion can be attached to Amos Gately&rsquo;s
whole career! Why, he was a synonym for all that
is best in finance, in politics, in society! I&rsquo;m glad
you didn&rsquo;t hint this before Olive Raynor! It would
have crushed the poor child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to learn it sooner or later,&rdquo; and
Wise shook his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it
in my mind. You see, &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; usually took
her news to Rodman and he secretly, and by means
of the secret elevator, carried it to Gately who gave
it over to the agents of the German Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this?&rdquo; asked Rivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get Rodman to admit it, but when I
taxed him with something of the sort, he flew into
such a rage that I&rsquo;m sure I struck the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rodman now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Department of Justice has his case in hand.
They&rsquo;ll look after him. But I don&rsquo;t see how we can
connect him with the murder of Gately. I don&rsquo;t
for a minute doubt he&rsquo;d be quite capable of it, but
he wasn&rsquo;t there at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Sadie Kent?&rdquo; and Rivers frowned
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at the time of the shooting. Brice, here,
can testify to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless she was in hiding,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and she
wasn&rsquo;t, for I looked in the cupboards and all that.
We seem to have proved Sadie there before the
murderer was, but I don&rsquo;t suspect her of shooting
Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Wise, &ldquo;but it was unusual for
her to go to Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office. It must be that she
had grown more daring of late, and had some hold
over Gately, so that she felt safe in going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they get all that out of Sadie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a slippery sort. She pretends to speak
frankly, but what she tells means little and is misleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the moment, down at Kenilworth House.
Detained there till they&rsquo;re sure of the persons working
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get away,&rdquo; said Rivers, &ldquo;she ought to be
in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it was a strange thing, but this casual
prophecy of Rivers&rsquo; was fulfilled the very next day!</p>
<p>I was in my office, absorbedly conversing with
Norah on the all-engrossing subject of the Gately
case, when Zizi dashed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone I did it!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and tossing the
folds of her voluminous black cape over her shoulder,
she folded her arms and assumed the attitude of
Napoleon; scowling from under her heavy black
brows, though her eyes were dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; I asked, while Norah
gazed enchanted at the dramatic little figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returned the missing &lsquo;Link&rsquo; to her rightful
owners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Sadie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. You know, Mr. Rivers said she&rsquo;d
break loose from that Whatchacallit House, and
make trouble&mdash;also, which she done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it,&rdquo; I urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. Mr. Wise sent me
to tell you that,&mdash;and a lot of other messages.
Well,&rdquo; and Zizi&rsquo;s black eyes snapped with satisfaction,
&ldquo;somebody called this morning to see Miss
Raynor. And that somebody was none other than
Sadie, &lsquo;The Link!&rsquo; She sent up a different name,&mdash;I
forget what, now,&mdash;and Miss Olive went down
to see her. And she blackmailed Miss Olive good
and plenty! You see, little Ziz was listening from
behind a convenient porti&egrave;re, and I heard it all.
The whole idea was that if Miss Olive would quit
all investigations, there would be no tales told. But
if she kept up her detective work,&mdash;that is, if she
kept Mr. Wise on the job, then revelations would
be made about her guardian, Mr. Gately, that Sadie
said would blast his name forever. Olive seemed to
understand just what these revelations were, for she
didn&rsquo;t ask, but she was scared to pieces, and was
about ready to give in when I slid into the game.
But,&mdash;before I joined the confab I called up Penny
Wise on an upstairs telephone and invited him to
come along hastily and bring a squad of policemen
or something that could hold that &lsquo;Link&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I sauntered into the library, where the
blackmailing session was being held, and I stood by.
We had a war of words,&mdash;&lsquo;The Link&rsquo; and I,&mdash;but
it didn&rsquo;t amount to much, for I was really only
sparring for time till Penny Wise blew in. But I
kept Miss Olive quiet, and I gave &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; a
song and dance that made her think some! I told
her we knew she wrote the blackmailing letter to
Miss Olive, signed &lsquo;A Friend,&rsquo; and that she could
be jailed for that! She wilted some, but carried it
off with a high hand and soon Penny came and he
had his little helpers along. They were in uniform,
and they seemed mighty glad to get back their long-lost
friend and comrade, &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You clever little piece!&rdquo; cried Norah, &ldquo;to think
of your getting that girl again, after she had broken
loose! Didn&rsquo;t they appreciate it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Zizi smiled, modestly; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all in
the day&rsquo;s work. I don&rsquo;t care much about appreciation,
except from Mr. Wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had thrown off her long cloak, and her
slender, lithe little figure leaned over the back of a
chair. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she cried, twirling round suddenly
to me, &ldquo;I did do one more little trick! When they
were taking Sadie away, I sidled up to her, and&mdash;oh,
well, I s&rsquo;pose I am a direct descendant of some
light-fingered gentry,&mdash;I picked her pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her pocket,&mdash;by which I mean her little leather
hand-bag, was never out of her hand for a minute!
The way she hung on to it,&mdash;fairly clutched it,&mdash;made
me think it contained something of interest to
our side. So I just picked it on general principles.
And I got the goods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Norah and I together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some stuff in code, or in cipher,&mdash;I dunno just
what it was. But Penny took it, and he&rsquo;s tickled
to death to get it. Gibberish, of course, but he&rsquo;ll
make it out. He&rsquo;s clever at ciphers, and it will
likely be the final proof of &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;s&rsquo; perfidy,&mdash;and,&mdash;&rdquo; here
Zizi&rsquo;s head drooped, and her eyes saddened,&mdash;&ldquo;maybe
it will show up Mr. Gately
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know! But,&rdquo; she brightened again,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s something else yet! I&rsquo;m on the job day
and night, you know, and, if you inquire of me,
I&rsquo;d just as lief spill it to you, that Miss Olive is
a whole lot interested in that fascinating Mr.
Rivers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now,&rdquo; and Norah looked reproof at the
saucy, smiling girl, &ldquo;Miss Raynor is the <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> of
Amory Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy! she told me she never was engaged to
Mr. Manning. And when I tease her about Mr.
Rivers, she blushes the loveliest pink you ever saw,
and says, &lsquo;Oh, Zizi, don&rsquo;t be a silly!&rsquo; but then she
sits and waits for me to be a silly again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she hasn&rsquo;t seen Rivers half a dozen times,&rdquo;
I said, smiling at Zizi&rsquo;s flight of imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she scoffed; &ldquo;if ever there was
a case of love at first sight, those two have got it!
They don&rsquo;t really know it themselves yet, but if
Amory Manning wants Miss Olive, he&rsquo;d better come
out of hiding and win her while the winning&rsquo;s good!
And it&rsquo;s my belief he&rsquo;d be too late now! And here&rsquo;s
a straw to show which way that wind blows. The
picture of Mr. Manning that was on Miss Olive&rsquo;s
dresser has disappeared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not mean anything,&rdquo; I said, for I
didn&rsquo;t think it right to encourage Zizi&rsquo;s romancing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I asked Miss Olive about it, and she hesitated
and stammered, and never did say why she
had put it away. And, too, you ought to see her
eyes smile when she expects Mr. Rivers to call!
He&rsquo;s making a lace pattern for her, and they have
to discuss it a lot! Oh&eacute;, oho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mischievous little face took on a gentle,
tender look and Norah smiled with the sympathy
of one who, like all the rest of the world, loves a
lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, musingly, &ldquo;none of this brings us
any nearer to the discovery of Amos Gately&rsquo;s
murderer, or to the discovery of Amory Manning,&mdash;which
are the two ends and aims of our present
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Brice,&rdquo;&mdash;Zizi&rsquo;s
face grew very serious,&mdash;&ldquo;that those two quests
will lead you to the same man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her,&mdash;stunned to silence.</p>
<p>Then, as suddenly shocked into speech, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
I fairly shouted, &ldquo;it never did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />Wise&rsquo;s Pipe Dream</h2>
<p>The mystery was a baffling one. I learned
from Pennington Wise that he had a pipe
dream that Amory Manning had killed Amos
Gately.</p>
<p>But, save for the faithful Zizi, he could find no
one to share his suspicion. It was too absurd. In
the first place, had Manning done the deed, he never
would have hung around the scene of the crime as
he did, for nearly an hour. I remembered perfectly
his demeanor and expression, as I saw him,
with Olive Raynor that afternoon. He was deeply
concerned, greatly shocked, and most considerate
and thoughtful of Olive, but there was no shadow
of guilt on his fine, strong face.</p>
<p>I had looked at him closely both during the excitement
of the tragedy itself, and later, as we were
in the street-car, and I noted his grave, serious
countenance, but though he seemed puzzled and
anxious, there was no mark of Cain on his brow.</p>
<p>I told Wise this, and he listened, duly impressed,
but, as he finally owned up, he saw no other way to
look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Rodman,&rdquo; he asserted; &ldquo;that chap is
a traitor and a spy, but he&rsquo;s no murderer. And, too,
he was in cahoots with Gately, and the last thing
he wanted was to lose his patron. It wasn&rsquo;t Sadie,
of course; she too, wanted Gately alive, not dead.
I know the unwillingness of Olive&rsquo;s guardian to
listen to Manning&rsquo;s suit, seems a slight motive,&mdash;yet
where can we find a suspect with a stronger
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t as yet,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;but there must
be people implicated in that spy business,&mdash;if that&rsquo;s
a true bill against Gately&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a true bill, all right. Amos Gately
was a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing! Miss Raynor will
have to know it sooner or later. She really knows
it now, but she won&rsquo;t let herself believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that paper Zizi took from Sadie
Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on. Meet me this
afternoon at the Raynor house, and I may be able
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big, cheerful library at Olive&rsquo;s house had
come to be our general meeting-place of an afternoon.
I usually dropped in there about four o&rsquo;clock,
and was pretty sure to find Wise or Rivers or both
there. Zizi was a whole vaudeville show herself,
and Olive was always cordial and hospitable. Mrs.
Vail, too, was a gentle old lady, and I had grown
to like her.</p>
<p>So I went, as Wise suggested, and found him
poring over the mysterious paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Looking at it for the first time, I saw merely a
lot of letters, pen-written, and arranged in long
rows that ran clear across the sheet.</p>
<p>There were perhaps twenty rows or so, and each
row held about thirty letters. They were carefully
aligned and evenly spaced, and, without doubt, contained
a hidden message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve unraveled a lot of cryptograms in my
time,&rdquo; said Wise, &ldquo;but this isn&rsquo;t a cryptogram. I
mean it isn&rsquo;t in cipher code,&mdash;there&rsquo;s some other way
of getting at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all studied it. Olive, Zizi, Wise, and I bent
our heads over the table where it lay, while Mrs.
Vail looked on from a little distance, and babbled
about some man she knew once, who could solve
secret writings.</p>
<p>Suddenly Zizi jumped up, and running around the
table, viewed the paper from the other side.</p>
<p>She cocked her funny little head sidewise, and
then wagged it knowingly as she took a few steps
further and looked at the paper from another angle.
All round the table she went, and finally, with a
murmur of apology, took up the paper and held it
laterally in front of her eager eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee!&rdquo; she crowed in an ecstasy of satisfaction;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! You have to have a pattern to
read it by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pattern!&rdquo; I repeated, blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep! A paper with holes in it,&mdash;a key-paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and Wise looked as if a light had burst
upon him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Ziz! You&rsquo;re the wonder-child,
after all! Stoo-pid! Stoo-pid!&rdquo; and he beat
his forehead in self-abasement. &ldquo;And, oh! I say,
Brice, what did you tell me once about Swiss
cheese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swiss cheese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; don&rsquo;t you remember? A carriage-call
check&mdash;with holes in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that thing. Yes; it was on Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
desk,&mdash;Hudson, the foxy detective, took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, by sending for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; cried Zizi; &ldquo;where? Headquarters?&rdquo;
and she was already flinging on her coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; said Wise, giving the girl a quick,
appreciative glance. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll beat any other messenger,
and she&rsquo;ll find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We heard Zizi&rsquo;s imperative little voice demanding
a cab from the telephone, and a bit later heard
the street door close behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; and Wise explained it to us, &ldquo;Zizi
noticed,&mdash;and then I did,&mdash;these letters. At first
glance they seem to be perfectly regular, but noted
closely there are some, here and there, that are a
microscopic fraction of space nearer or farther away
from others. And that shows what kind of a cipher
it is. We may be mistaken about the carriage check,
but I truly believe when we get it we can read the
message this paper carries. We certainly can&rsquo;t
without it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>This was so true that we laid the paper aside until
the return of our winged Mercury.</p>
<p>She came soon, and waved triumphantly the perforated
card she had gone in quest of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;let me try it as a
reward for getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go to it,&rdquo; said Wise, and flinging off
her cape, Zizi bent over the puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s it! It&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she cried, exultantly. &ldquo;See,
oh, Wise One!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective took the paper and the card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, generously sharing the first
sight of the solution with us, &ldquo;this card has seven
holes, at irregular distances. By placing it in the
right position on this solid bank of letters, certain
ones show through the holes, and these,&mdash;I hope,&mdash;will
spell the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it did. After re-adjusting the key card several
times, Wise finally got it right, and the letters
that could be seen through the holes in this card, as
he moved it along, spelled coherent words and
sentences. Of course, the other letters were not to
be used.</p>
<p>He read the message aloud, and as we suspected,
it was information concerning the shipment of munitions,
and told of certain sailing dates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spy work of the cleverest type,&rdquo; Wise exclaimed;
&ldquo;you see, &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; got her information
from stolen telegrams, and recorded it in this way,
so it would be unintelligible to anyone not having
this card,&mdash;or a duplicate of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scrutinized with interest the letters as they
showed clearly through the little round holes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The information is of no particular value now,&rdquo;
Wise said; &ldquo;it refers to yesterday as the sailing
date. The point is, that this card,&mdash;this key card,
was found on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused: a glance at Olive&rsquo;s agonized face
stopped the words he would have uttered. But we
all knew. That card, found on Amos Gately&rsquo;s desk,
or in his desk drawer, proved that he was implicated
in the interception of these messages, that he was
guilty of treason to his country!</p>
<p>Wise tried to help matters by saying, hastily,
&ldquo;Perhaps it was a plant! Perhaps this card was
put where it was found by some sly scoundrel for
the purpose of misleading&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Olive, faintly; &ldquo;you are kind, Mr.
Wise, but you are saying that merely to give me a
ray of comfort and hope. You know better. You
believe,&mdash;and I fear I must believe,&mdash;my guardian
was involved in some wrong, some grave wrong&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down utterly and sobbed in Zizi&rsquo;s arms
which were opened to receive her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Feeling that our further stay was an intrusion,
Rivers and I took leave, and Wise came along with
us. We three went down to my rooms, and continued
our confab without the embarrassment of
Olive&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clearing itself up pretty quickly in some respects,&rdquo;
Wise said as he settled himself with a cigar,
and passed the box to Rivers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so surprised
as some at Gately&rsquo;s perfidy. It seems the
Government has been onto him for some time,&mdash;at
least, they suspected him, and were secretly investigating
his private affairs. That Sadie person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Wise,&rdquo; I interrupted him, &ldquo;you
sized her up perfectly! Did you ever hear about
that, Rivers? Mr. Wise saw only the girl&rsquo;s hatpin,
and from it he drew an exact portrait of &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;
herself. How did you do it, Wise? Tell us the
details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like all those deductions it was simpler than it
sounded,&rdquo; the detective said, smiling. &ldquo;You see,
Mr. Rivers, the head of the pin was a big good-looking
scarab. I don&rsquo;t know yet whether it was a
real one, but if not it was a first-class imitation.
This argued a person of education and taste. The
average young woman doesn&rsquo;t lean toward scarabs.
Then, there was a short bit of a human hair caught
in the setting. This was black, rather coarse, and
strong, denoting a healthy, buxom brunette. Hair
is a clear indication of physical appearance, as a
rule. That&rsquo;s how I know you aren&rsquo;t Amory Manning,&rdquo;
he broke off suddenly and looked at Case
Rivers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had his description from Miss Raynor
and from Brice, here, and they agree that Manning
had dark, heavy hair, rather&mdash;footballish type.
Yours is light, fine, and a little scant. And you
have all the characteristics that belong to it. Oh,
yes, I admit I&rsquo;ve been trying to fasten Manning&rsquo;s
identity on you, but without success.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; laughed Rivers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
trying to connect up with the missing Manning myself,
but I can&rsquo;t work it. So, I&rsquo;m out for the reward
for finding that elusive individual. But I fear he&rsquo;s
gone beyond recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Wise put in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out who
offers the reward. And, if you please, it&rsquo;s none
other than the United States Government!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Rivers asked, interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems Manning is,&mdash;or was,&mdash;a Secret
Service man and he was set on the trail of Amos
Gately. He worked secretly, of course, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was kidnaped by Gately&rsquo;s friends!&rdquo; I
cried; &ldquo;by some of Rodman&rsquo;s underlings, and put
out of the way! I don&rsquo;t believe Manning is alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on about the hatpin, Mr. Wise, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
urged Rivers. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to grow up to be
a detective and I&rsquo;m taking notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wise, good-humoredly, &ldquo;as I remember
it, I mentioned the lady&rsquo;s good teeth. This,
because the prints on the rather soft gold of the
pin were straight and even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said she was proud of them,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A glittering generality,&rdquo; and Wise laughed.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all girls proud of good teeth? Also, I assumed
she had rather flashy tastes, for the scarab,
large, and of a bright greenish-blue color, was not
a quiet affair. A strong perfume clung to it, which
also indicated a certain lack of refinement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you said untidy habits,&rdquo; I reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the pin was bent to a real crookedness.
Also, it had been broken and mended. The break
proving probable carelessness, and the mending
seemed to me to show that she was sentimentally
fond of it, for it was skilfully mended and the
cost of that would have bought a new one, I should
judge. I assumed her to be somewhat intellectual
to care so much for a scarab, and I deduced her
fairly well off to own and to care for the
rather valuable trinket. None of these deductions
amounted to much by itself, but the combination
helped us to find a way to look for the owner.
Of course, the cigarette stubs and the powder-paper
helped, too. In fact, Miss Kent left pretty strong
evidences of her call on Mr. Gately. But,&mdash;she
didn&rsquo;t kill him. Now, who did? We are learning
lots of things, but not one shred of evidence have
we yet found against any individual as the actual
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;You see, the shadow of the
head that I saw on the glass door couldn&rsquo;t have been
Rodman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it may have been anybody&rsquo;s. I mean, it
shows that heads look pretty much alike, when
merely shadowed on a thick, waved glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I mused, &ldquo;it may have been anybody&rsquo;s.
But whose? It seems as if we ought to have a suspect
by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a suspect,&rdquo; spoke up Case Rivers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into this thing for all I&rsquo;m worth. The
way lies through the Rodman crowd. &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;
sold her information to Rodman and he took it to
Gately, but of late, &lsquo;The Link&rsquo; became more bold
and went straight to Gately herself. Now, there
must be others concerned, and an interview with
Miss Kent would give us an inkling of who they
are. She&rsquo;s lost some of her bravado, by this time,
I&rsquo;ve no doubt, and I&rsquo;m going to chase her up. Then,
too, I want to go to Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office. I&rsquo;ve never
been there yet! Don&rsquo;t think, Wise, that I&rsquo;m butting
in on your game, but sometimes two heads are better
than one, if one is a nameless wanderer on the face
of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Rivers,&rdquo; and Wise nodded genially,
&ldquo;go in and win. We&rsquo;re together on this matter.
And when it&rsquo;s over, I&rsquo;m going to take up <i>your</i> case,
and see just how, when, and where you fell through
the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; and Rivers looked
earnestly at the detective, &ldquo;for I see that trip
every night in my dreams. I see myself falling
through&mdash;oh, I won&rsquo;t bore you with that same old
story!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bore me, but just now we&rsquo;ll put all our
energies on the present puzzle. We must get
Gately&rsquo;s murderer, and then we must get Amory
Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zizi says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she does,&rdquo; returned Wise, looking
thoughtful. &ldquo;Zizi says Manning is the murderer.
But the kid has no reason to say it but a hunch.
She&rsquo;s a witch though for hunches, and I keep her
idea in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Rivers spoke positively, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
seem to me that Manning is the murderer. If he
was in the Secret Service, he may be purposely in
hiding now, for some reason entirely unconnected
with Amos Gately&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; assented Wise. &ldquo;Only, as I say,
I often remember Zizi&rsquo;s notions because they so
often pan out correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a marvel, that child,&rdquo; said Rivers;
&ldquo;where&rsquo;d you get her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my model. In civilian life, I&rsquo;m by way
of being an artist, you know. I sketch her over
and over, but never have I successfully caught her
smile. She&rsquo;s a witch child, a sprite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she seems gypsy born. But clever! And
of a charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that,&rdquo; agreed Wise. &ldquo;And a good little
thing. Devoted to me, like a faithful dog, and yet,
absolutely impersonal. Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t get along at
all without Ziz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>And almost as he spoke the door opened and Zizi
came gliding in. Her mode of entering a room was
one of her individual characteristics. She slid in
softly and unobtrusively, yet one was at once aware
of her. It seemed to electrify the atmosphere, and
the place was brighter and more vital in feeling.
She moved across the room as quietly as a shadow,
she said no word, yet her whole presence spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ziz,&rdquo; and Wise smiled at her.
&ldquo;Watcha want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rivers,&rdquo; she replied, flashing her black eyes
at him. &ldquo;Miss Olive sent me. And she wants the
other crystal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new mystery?&rdquo; and Wise laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see through the other crystal! Has it to do with a
pair of glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Rivers took out a pocket-book, from
which he extracted some flimsy paper. These
proved to be tracings of snow crystals similar to
those I had seen him drawing while he was still
in the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; Zizi exclaimed, as she took the
traced patterns. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; and she showed them
to Wise, &ldquo;Miss Olive is making lace work,&mdash;and
Mr. Rivers makes her these patterns. Aren&rsquo;t they
exquisite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were. They were forms of snow crystals,
than which there is nothing more beautiful, and
Rivers had adapted and combined them into a delicate
lace-like pattern, which Olive was to copy with
linen threads, or whatever women use to make lace
out of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to take them round,&rdquo; Rivers said;
&ldquo;I hope the delay hasn&rsquo;t bothered Miss Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Zizi assured him, &ldquo;but she is impatient
to see this new design and couldn&rsquo;t wait. So
I offered to run down for it. I knew you were
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just going up to Miss Raynor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Rivers
spoke as if disappointed, &ldquo;and the patterns are my
only excuse for a call! So, if you please, Miss Zizi,
I&rsquo;ll take them to the impatient lady, and I&rsquo;ll go at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s gone out, Mr. Rivers, she was
about to go as I left. If you telephone you&rsquo;ll likely
catch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite unembarrassed at our knowing smiles,
Rivers took up my desk-telephone and called Olive&rsquo;s
number. While waiting for the response he picked
up a pencil from my pen-tray, and idly drew a snow
crystal on the big desk-blotter.</p>
<p>I watched him, for his skill fascinated me. He
drew the dainty six-sided figure with the accuracy of
a designer. The tiny fronds, all six alike, made a
lovely hexagonal form as it grew beneath his
fingers.</p>
<p>He was apparently unconscious of what he was
doing, and drew without thinking, for he spoke to
us several times while waiting for the desired connection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>At last Olive answered him, and he dropped the
pencil and talked to her. In a wheedlesome mood,
he persuaded her to defer her proposed errand until
he could join her and he would accompany her.
The kindly familiarity with which he carried on the
conversation and the jaunty assurance he showed
that she would accede to his request proved to us,
listeners perforce, that there was good comradeship
between them.</p>
<p>Rivers hung up the receiver, and turned to me
with a boyish smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Miss Raynor is waiting for me. I&rsquo;ll see you again,
tonight, Brice.&rdquo; And with a general nod of farewell
he went off.</p>
<p>Zizi sat staring at my desk.</p>
<p>The strange child was thinking of something,&mdash;more,
she had made a discovery, or had sensed
some new information.</p>
<p>She leaned over the desk, her outstretched hands
resting on the big blotter and her black eyes wide
with an expression of surprised fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her slender finger pointed only to the snow
crystal that Rivers had drawn. It was a graceful
figure, not quite finished, but a delicate tracery of
one of the myriad forms that snow crystals show.
How often I had looked at the lovely things as they
rested for a moment on my dark coat sleeve when
I was out in a snowstorm. And after seeing Rivers
draw them so skilfully, several times, they had
taken on a new interest to me. But what had so
moved Zizi I could not imagine. It was as if the
little drawing were fraught with some dreadful
significance of which I knew nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Nor was Pennington Wise any more aware than
I of the girl&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>He smiled quizzically, and said, &ldquo;Well, Zizi,
girl, what&rsquo;s hypnotizing you? That drawing of
Rivers&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Zizi turned her big black eyes from
my face to Wise&rsquo;s, and gave a queer little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it, girlie,&rdquo; urged Wise. &ldquo;Tell your
old Penny Wise what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do what I want?&rdquo; she asked, her
voice tense and thrilled with strong feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; to the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look at that thing! That snow crystal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve looked,&rdquo; and after a moment&rsquo;s close
scrutiny Wise turned his eyes again to the eerie
face, so vividly emotional, so white with that unnamed
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look, too, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; and I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note the design,&rdquo; Zizi went on, &ldquo;see just how
the fronds are marked. Isn&rsquo;t it funny how people
always draw or scribble while they&rsquo;re waiting to get
a telephone call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Ziz,&rdquo; and Penny Wise patted
her arm, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re putting up a game on us. We
know Rivers draws these things beautifully. Why
act as if you never knew it before?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; and Zizi rose and began to put
her long black cloak round her, shivering with excitement
as she did so. &ldquo;You come, too, Mr.
Brice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We obeyed the strange child, for I remembered
how Pennington Wise respected what he called her
&ldquo;hunches,&rdquo; and before going downstairs she directed
that I call a taxicab.</p>
<p>In the cab she said nothing, having already bade
us go to Amos Gately&rsquo;s office, and arrange to get
into the rooms.</p>
<p>And then, when we were there, when I had obtained
the keys from the bank people and had
entered the dim, quiet rooms, Zizi went straight
to the middle room, straight to Amos Gately&rsquo;s desk,
and lifting the telephone from where it stood on the
big desk-blotter, she disclosed the exact counterpart
of the snow crystal we had seen drawn at my desk
by Case Rivers!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />The Snowflake</h2>
<p>I looked at the design with interest, but
without at first grasping its true significance.</p>
<p>Pennington Wise looked at it aghast.
&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been there,&rdquo; said Zizi. &ldquo;I mean,
I saw it there one day when I was in this room with
Mr. Hudson, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d ever been here, Ziz,&rdquo; and
Wise smiled at the earnest little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, I was; and I happened to move the telephone,
and under it was that drawing. I didn&rsquo;t
think anything about it, as evidence, but I looked
at it &rsquo;cause it was so pretty. And I put the telephone
back over it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I searched this room,&rdquo; and Wise looked
mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably didn&rsquo;t lift the telephone, then,&rdquo;
Zizi returned, shaking her elfin head, while a deep
sorrow showed in her black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I did,&rdquo; Wise mused, thinking
back. &ldquo;I did pick up most of the desk fittings to
examine them but I suppose I didn&rsquo;t take hold of
the telephone at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not!&rdquo; Zizi was always ready to defend
Wise&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;How could you know there was
a picture under it? But, oh, Penny, what does it
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&mdash;let&rsquo;s get at it carefully. On the face
of it, it would seem as if Case Rivers must have
drawn this figure of a snow crystal. Everybody
has some peculiar habit, and especially, lots of people
have a habit of drawing some particular thing when
waiting at a telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked half a dozen men of late, and every
one says he scribbles words or draws some crude
combination of lines. But each one says he always
does the same thing, whatever it may be. Now, I
imagine, very few men draw snow crystals,&mdash;and
fewer still, draw them with this degree of perfection.
Again, granting they did, would any other individual
draw this identical design, with this accuracy
of drawing, that Case Rivers drew on the desk-blotter
at your house, Brice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it would be impossible that anyone
else could have done it,&rdquo; I replied, honestly,
though I began to see where our investigation was
leading us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> impossible,&rdquo; declared Wise. &ldquo;Two men
might draw snow crystals, but they would not both
choose this particular one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly the same,&rdquo; Zizi murmured, &ldquo;for I
brought Mr. Brice&rsquo;s with me: here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Calmly the girl took from her little hand-bag a
piece torn from my desk-blotter. It held the drawing
done by Rivers while he was waiting for his
telephone call and it was the precise duplicate of the
figure drawn on the blotter of Amos Gately&rsquo;s mahogany
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same pencil&mdash;or, rather, the same hand
drew those two,&rdquo; Wise said, positively, and I could
not contradict this.</p>
<p>Snow crystals are said by scientists to show hundreds
of different shapes, and almost any illustrated
dictionary or text-book of natural science shows
several specimens. This one we were looking at
was of simple but beautiful design and I felt sure
Rivers had copied it from some picture as one can
rarely keep a real snowflake long enough to copy its
form.</p>
<p>Anyway it was stretching the law of coincidence a
little too far to believe that two men would idly
draw the same form on a desk-blotter while telephoning.</p>
<p>Of course, this sketch on Amos Gately&rsquo;s desk need
not have been made while the artist&rsquo;s other hand
held the telephone receiver, but its juxtaposition to
the instrument indicated that it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Rivers drew this,&rdquo; Zizi declared,
her little head bobbing as she turned her black eyes
from one of us to the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>She wore a small turban made entirely of red
feathers,&mdash;soft breast feathers of some tropical bird,
I suppose. The hat set jauntily on her sleek black
hair, and the motions of her head were so quick
and birdlike, that she gave me a fleeting remembrance
of the human birds I saw in the play of
<i>Chantecler</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did,&rdquo; assented Wise, very gravely;
&ldquo;and now we must go on. Granting, for the moment,
that Case Rivers,&mdash;as we call him,&mdash;drew this
little sketch, he must have been in this office the
day of Amos Gately&rsquo;s murder. For I&rsquo;ve been told
that the blotter on this desk was changed every day,
and any marks or blots now on it were therefore
made on that day. If he did it, then,&mdash;or, rather,
when he did it, he was telephoning to somebody&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; put in Zizi, &ldquo;perhaps he was just sitting
here, talking to Mr. Gately. Maybe, he might
draw those things when he just sits idly as well as
when he telephones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;re right. Well, at any rate, he must
have been sitting here, opposite Mr. Gately, on that
very day. And I opine he was telephoning, but
that makes no difference. Now, if he was here, in
this office, on that day,&mdash;what was he here for, and
who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the murderer,&rdquo; said Zizi, but she spoke as
if she were a machine. The words seemed to come
from her lips without her own volition; her voice
was wooden, mechanical, and her eyes had a far-away,
vacant gaze. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who he is, but
he is the man who shot Mr. Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, Ziz,&rdquo; Wise shook her gently,
&ldquo;wake up! Don&rsquo;t jump at conclusions. He may be
the most innocent man in New York. He may have
been in here calling on Gately early in the day, and
his errand may have been of the most casual sort.
He may have had cause to telephone, and as he sat
waiting for his call, he sketched the snowflake pattern,
which is his habit when waiting. But that he
was here that day is a positive fact,&mdash;to my mind.
Now, it&rsquo;s for us to find out what he was here for,
and who he is. I don&rsquo;t favor going to him and
asking him pointblank. That peculiar phase of
amnesia from which he is suffering is a precarious
matter to deal with. A sudden shock might bring
back his memory,&mdash;or, it might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addle his brain!&rdquo; completed Zizi. &ldquo;All right,
oh, Most Wise Guy! But when you do find out the
truth, it will be that Case Rivers in his right mind
and in his own proper person killed Mr.
Gately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush up, Ziz! If you have such a fearful
hunch keep it to yourself. I&rsquo;m not going to believe
that, unless I have to! It has always been my conviction
that Rivers is,&mdash;or was, a worthwhile man.
I feel sure he was of importance in some line,&mdash;some
big line. Moreover, I believe his yarn about
falling through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; I cried, in amazement. &ldquo;You stand
for that! You believe he fell into the globe at
Canada,&mdash;or some Northern country, and fell out
again in New York City?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; and Wise smiled. &ldquo;But I believe
he had some mighty strange experience, of
which his tale is a pretty fair description, if not
entirely the literal truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, suppose he fell down a mine shaft in
Canada. Suppose that knocked out his memory.
Then suppose he was rescued and sent to New York
for treatment, say, at some private hospital or sanitarium.
Then suppose he escaped, and, still loony,
threw himself into the East River&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;only, there are lots of ways that he could
have that notion about his fall through the earth,
and have something real to base it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gammon and spinach!&rdquo; I remarked, my patience
exhausted; &ldquo;the man had a blow or a fall or
something that jarred his memory, but his &lsquo;falling
through the earth&rsquo; idea is a hallucination, pure and
simple. However, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Now we
must follow this new trail, and see if we can get
a line on his personality. He can&rsquo;t tell us what he
was here for,&mdash;if he doesn&rsquo;t remember that he was
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he does remember,&rdquo; Wise spoke musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy!&rdquo; and Zizi&rsquo;s saucy head nodded positively;
&ldquo;Mr. Rivers is sincere now, whatever he
was before. He doesn&rsquo;t remember shooting Mr.
Gately&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, Zizi!&rdquo; Wise spoke more sharply
than I had ever heard him. &ldquo;I forbid you to assume
that Rivers is the murderer,&mdash;you are
absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a hunch&mdash;&rdquo; Zizi&rsquo;s black eyes stared
fixedly at Wise, &ldquo;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hunch to yourself! I told you that
before! Now, hush up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not at all abashed, Zizi made a most wicked little
<i>moue</i> at him, but she said no more just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a new direction in which to look,
though,&rdquo; Wise went on, &ldquo;and we must get about it.
You remember, we found a hatpin here that led
us to Sadie, &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; as straight as a signboard
could have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; scoffed Zizi, &ldquo;with the help of Norah
and her powder-paper, and Jenny and her tattle-tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Wise was unperturbed; &ldquo;we got
her all the same. Now, perhaps the Man Who Fell
Through the Earth also left some indicative clews.
Let&rsquo;s look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t leave anything more indicative than
the drawing on the blotter,&rdquo; persisted Zizi. &ldquo;He
drew on Mr. Brice&rsquo;s blotter today and he drew on
this blotter of Mr. Gately&rsquo;s the day Mr. Gately was
killed. That much is certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, Zizi,&rdquo; agreed Wise; &ldquo;but nothing further
is certain as yet. But we may find something
more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>As he talked the detective rummaged in the desk
drawers. He pulled out the packet of papers that
had interested him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to read these,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you see,
they&rsquo;re dated in chronological order, and they must
mean something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where they come from,&rdquo; said Zizi, with an
air of wisdom; &ldquo;you see, Waldorf means a certain
message in their code book, and St. Regis means
another; Biltmore paper means another, and
so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, as usual,&rdquo; Wise said, so approvingly
that Zizi smiled all over her queer little
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;s&rsquo; spy business,&rdquo; she went
on, and I cried out in denial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come off, Mr. Brice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you may
as well admit, first as last, that you know Mr.
Gately was mixed up in this spy racket. I don&rsquo;t
know yet just how deeply or how knowingly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I caught at the straw, &ldquo;that he
was a go-between, but didn&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that at first,&rdquo; said Wise, &ldquo;I hoped it
was so. That, of course, would argue that he was
infatuated with Sadie and she wound him round her
finger and used him to further her schemes, while
he himself was innocent. But the theory, though a
pretty one, won&rsquo;t work. Gately wasn&rsquo;t quite gullible
enough for that, and, too, he is more deeply concerned
in it all than we know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;these letters,&mdash;I mean, these
blank sheets,&mdash;were sent to him by mail. One
came the day after he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. And, as Zizi says, they mean something
definite in accordance with a prepared code.
For instance, a sheet of Hotel Gotham paper, dated
December tenth, might mean that a certain transport,
indicated in the code book by that hotel, was
to sail on that date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a simple, child&rsquo;s-play explanation,&rdquo; said
Zizi,&mdash;&ldquo;but it may be the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Wise assented, &ldquo;there may be other
explanations and more complicated ones. But it
doesn&rsquo;t matter now. The receipt of these letters,&mdash;blank
letters,&mdash;was of secret value to Gately, and
proves him to have been pretty deeply mixed up in
it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Mr. Rivers?&rdquo; spoke up Zizi;
&ldquo;where does he come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks black,&rdquo; Wise declared. &ldquo;He was here
that day secretly. That is, he didn&rsquo;t come in at
Jenny&rsquo;s door. She doesn&rsquo;t recognize him, I asked
her. Therefore, he came in by one of these other
doors, or up in the secret elevator. In either case,
he didn&rsquo;t want his visit known. So he is a wrongdoer,
with Gately, and&mdash;probably, with Rodman.
They&rsquo;re all tarred with the same brush. The trail
of the spy serpent is over them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Zizi, and her face was stormy, &ldquo;my
nice Mr. Rivers isn&rsquo;t any spy! He hasn&rsquo;t anything
to do with that spy matter!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;you said he was the
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d rather be a murderer than a spy!&rdquo;
Her eyes snapped and her whole thin little body
quivered with indignation. &ldquo;A murder is a decent
crime compared to spy work! Oh, my nice Mr.
Rivers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down and cried convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo; said Wise, not unkindly, after
a brief glance at the shaking little figure. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
always better for a crying spell. It clears her atmosphere.
Now, Brice, let&rsquo;s get busy. As Zizi
says, you must admit that there&rsquo;s no doubt that
Amos Gately was pretty deeply into the game.
Even if he was unduly friendly with Sadie Kent,
it was indubitably through and because of their
dealings together in the stolen telegram business.
The way I see it is that Sadie sold her intercepted
messages to the highest bidder. This was George
Rodman, but above him was Amos Gately. Oh,
don&rsquo;t look so incredulous. It isn&rsquo;t the first time a
bank president has gone wrong on the side. Gately
never was unfaithful to his office, he never misappropriated
funds or anything of that sort, but for
some reason or other, whether money gain, or hope
of other reward, he did betray his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t deny it,&mdash;or, rather, I could deny
it, but only because of my still unshattered faith
in Amos Gately. I could bring no proof of my
denial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, musingly, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t yet proved
Gately mixed up in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Wise; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this enough proof?
These blank letters, for that&rsquo;s what they are,&mdash;the
proved visit here of Sadie, &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; and the fact
that Gately was shot,&mdash;by someone,&mdash;with no
known reason,&mdash;all that goes to show that the murderer
had some secret motive, some unknown cause
for getting Gately out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it, as you put it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I will not
believe Amos Gately a spy,&mdash;or conniving at spy
business until I have to. I shall continue to believe
he was a tool&mdash;an innocent tool&mdash;of the Rodman
and Sadie Kent combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Brice, keep your faith as long as you
can, but, I tell you, you&rsquo;ll soon have to admit that
I&rsquo;m right. Gately, as we all know, was a peculiar
man. He had few friends, he had little or no social
life, and he did have secret callers and a secret mode
of entrance and exit from his offices. All this
shows something to hide,&mdash;it is unexplainable for a
man who has nothing to conceal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Wise,&rdquo; I said, finally, &ldquo;I suppose you
<i>are</i> right. But still we must continue our search
for the murderer. We don&rsquo;t seem to progress much
in that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but soon,&rdquo; Wise said, optimistically;
&ldquo;the ax is laid at the root of the tree,&mdash;we are on
the right track&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Case Rivers?&rdquo; I cried, in alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Case Rivers,&mdash;perhaps,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as sure as Zizi is that the evidence points
to him as the murderer, but we must conclude that
he was in this room the day of the murder,&mdash;and
what else could he have been here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; I stormed. &ldquo;Dozens of things!
Hundreds of things! Why, man alive, every person
who set foot in this room on that day didn&rsquo;t necessarily
kill Amos Gately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every person who set foot in this room on that
day is his potential murderer,&rdquo; Wise returned,
calmly. &ldquo;Every person must be suspected,&mdash;or, at
least, investigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, after realizing that he spoke truly,
&ldquo;you investigate the question of Rivers&rsquo; visit here
that day. I don&rsquo;t want to do that. But I&rsquo;m going
down to Headquarters now, and perhaps I&rsquo;ll dig up
something of importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I did. A visit to the Chief told me the interesting
tale of the further discoveries of Sadie
Kent&rsquo;s industries. It seems the Federal agents
had found a complete and powerful wireless station
in a cottage at Southeast Beach, a fairly popular
summer resort. The cottage was seemingly
untenanted, but some unexplained wires which ran
along the rafters of an adjoining house led to the
discovery of the auxiliary wireless station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>Experts had broken into the locked house and had
found a cleverly concealed keyboard of a wireless
apparatus. Further search had disclosed the whole
thing, and, moreover, had brought out the fact,
that the adjoining cottage was occupied by two
apparently innocent old people, who were really in
the employ of Sadie Kent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Link&rdquo; was a person of importance, and
though she passed for a mere telegraph operator,
she was one of the most important links in the
German spy system in the United States.</p>
<p>In the room where the wireless apparatus was
found there were also quantities of letter paper
from the various hotels of New York City.</p>
<p>These sheets, abstracted from the writing-rooms
of the hotels, were the code system used in forwarding
the stolen intelligence.</p>
<p>It all hung together, and the bunch of those
hotel papers found in Gately&rsquo;s desk, and especially
the fact that one reached his address the day after
his demise proved, beyond all doubt, his implication
in the despicable business.</p>
<p>Now, I thought, to what extent or in what way
was Case Rivers concerned? Surely the man had
been in Gately&rsquo;s office on that fatal day. I had no
idea that he had killed the banker,&mdash;that was only
Zizi&rsquo;s foolishness,&mdash;but he had certainly been there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>It came to me suddenly that if Rivers could be
taken again to the Gately offices, the rooms, the
associations, might possibly bring back his lost
memory, and let him reinstate himself in his real
personality. To be sure, this might prove him the
murderer, but if so, it would be only the course of
justice; and, on the other hand, if it explained his
innocent or casual call on Gately that, too, was what
the man deserved.</p>
<p>And so I went at once to see Rivers. I found
him in his rooms, the ones he had taken while he
was to assist Wise in his work, and he greeted me
cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plot thickens,&rdquo; he said as I told him of
Sadie&rsquo;s wireless station. &ldquo;I knew that girl was a
sly one. She&rsquo;s one of the most important people in
the big spy web. She&rsquo;s one of their spyders, who
spin a pretty web and attract gullible flies. Amos
Gately fell for her charms,&mdash;you know, Brice, she
is a siren,&mdash;and somehow she lured him into the
web she so deftly spun. To my mind, Gately was
a good, upright citizen, who fell for a woman&rsquo;s
wiles. I&rsquo;m not sure about this, it may be he was
mixed up in spy work before Sadie came on the
scene,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m certain she was accessory before,
during, or after the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accessory to his murder?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily; but strongly accessory to his
wrongdoing in the matter of treason. I think she,
for a time, worked Gately through Rodman, but,
latterly, she grew bolder or found she could do more
by personal visits and she came and went by the
secret elevator, pretty much as she chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to have Miss Raynor know this,&rdquo; I said
with a covert glance at Rivers, to see how he took
the remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; he said, as frankly as a boy; &ldquo;I may
as well tell you, Brice, that I love that girl. She is,
to me, the very crown of womanhood. I have worshiped
her from the first moment I saw her. But,
understand, I have no hopes,&mdash;no aspirations. I
shall never offer my hand and heart to any woman
while I have no name to offer. And I shall never
have a name. If I haven&rsquo;t yet discovered my own
identity I never can. No, I&rsquo;m no pessimist, and I
know that some time some sudden shock might
restore my memory all in a minute, yet I can&rsquo;t bank
on such a possibility. I&rsquo;ve talked this over with
Rankin,&mdash;he&rsquo;s the doctor who&rsquo;s following up my
case,&mdash;time and again. He says that a sudden and
very forcible shock is needed to restore my memory,
and that it may come and&mdash;it may not. He says it
can&rsquo;t be forced or brought about knowingly,&mdash;it will
have to be a coincidence,&mdash;a happening that will jar
the inert cells of my brain&mdash;or, something like
that,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember the scientific terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rivers passed his hand wearily across his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>I was in a quandary. I had gone to see the
man with full purpose of luring him to Gately&rsquo;s
office and confronting him with the sketched snowflake
on the blotting-pad. Now, since he had confided
to me his love for Olive Raynor, I shrank
from doing anything that might prove him to be
Amos Gately&rsquo;s murderer. For I was fond of Miss
Raynor, in a deeply respectful and unpresumptuous
fashion. And I had noticed several things of late
that made me feel pretty sure that her friendship
for Rivers was true and deep, if indeed it were
not something more than friendship. This, to be
sure, would argue but a fickle loyalty to the memory
of Amory Manning, but as Norah and I agreed,
when talking it over, Miss Raynor had never shown
any desperate grief at Manning&rsquo;s disappearance,&mdash;at
least, not more than the loss of a casual friend
might arouse.</p>
<p>But I knew where my duty lay. And so I said,
&ldquo;Rivers, I wish you&rsquo;d go round to Mr. Gately&rsquo;s
office with me. Don&rsquo;t you think that if you were
there,&mdash;and you never have been,&mdash;you might
chance upon some clew that has escaped the notice
of Wise or Hudson or myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought myself I&rsquo;d like
to go there. Not, as you politely suggest, to find
overlooked clews, but just as a matter of general
interest. I&rsquo;m out, you know, to find the murderer,
and also to trace the vanished Amory Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />Zizi&rsquo;s Hunch</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid,&rdquo; and Norah wagged her head
sagaciously, while her gray eyes had an
apprehensive expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of the truth. You see, Mr. Brice, our
friend Rivers is nobody&rsquo;s fool. He&rsquo;s onto most
points regarding this case, and now, he&rsquo;s getting
onto himself. That astute little scrap of humanity,
Zizi, knows he is. Of course, living with Miss
Raynor, as she does, she has opportunities every day
to see Mr. Rivers, for he&rsquo;s eternally hanging around
the Raynor house. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s an idler;
not by a long shot. On the contrary, his middle
name is efficiency! He puts over a lot of work in
a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of work and how do you know so
much about him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>We were in my office, waiting for Rivers, who
had promised to come to see me, and to look into
the Gately rooms. It was now nearly half an hour
after the time he had set for his call, and as it was
not his habit to be tardy, I was surprised. I had
begun to look upon Rivers as a man of importance,
not only in the matters with which we were associated,
but he showed so much general ability and
force of character that I wondered who or what he
would turn out to be. For I felt sure he would
find himself, and even if he never discovered who
he had been he would make a new name and a well
worthwhile individuality for himself yet.</p>
<p>Norah, too, admired him, and seemed to know as
much of his capabilities, or more, than I did myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just what sort of work, but I think
it&rsquo;s connected with the mysteries we&rsquo;re up against
ourselves. And I know about him, because Zizi told
me. She sees everything he does,&mdash;when she&rsquo;s with
him, I mean. Not a gesture or motion escapes her
notice. And she&rsquo;s watching his attitude toward
Miss Raynor. She says,&mdash;Zizi does,&mdash;that Mr.
Rivers is over head and ears in love with Olive, but
he won&rsquo;t tell her so because he is, as he puts it, a
self-named man! Zizi heard him call himself that
when talking to Miss Raynor, and then he just
looked away, and resolutely changed the subject.
But she thinks,&mdash;Zizi does,&mdash;that he&rsquo;s working
night and day to find out who he is, and she&rsquo;s sure
he&rsquo;ll find out. And also, he&rsquo;s working to find Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s murderer, and he&rsquo;s hunting for Amory
Manning. No wonder the man&rsquo;s busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why is he afraid to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that he is; but you know Zizi has
a hunch that he&rsquo;s the murderer, and I think maybe
he is. That snowflake sketch proves he was there
that day and as his presence isn&rsquo;t accounted for, why
may he not have been the slayer? And, why may
he not have an inkling or a suspicion of it, and dread
to verify his fears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good gracious, Norah, even granting he
was in Gately&rsquo;s office that day, he needn&rsquo;t have done
the shooting. There are about one million other
errands he could have been there on. Perhaps he
was a commercial traveler, selling laces, and drew
the design for a sample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, Mr. Brice, you talk like a Tom-noddy!
Drummer, indeed! I can tell you whatever
calling Case Rivers followed, it was far different
from that of a selling agent! I&rsquo;ll bet he was
a lawyer, at least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least!&rdquo; I mocked her; &ldquo;understand, pray, I
consider my profession somewhat above the least of
the professions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for <i>you</i> dignify it to a high standing,&rdquo; and
the gray eyes flashed me the smile of appreciation
that I was looking for. I may as well admit that
I was growing very fond of those two gray eyes and
their owner, and I had a pretty strong conviction
that after the present case was all settled I should
turn my attention to the winning of the exclusive
right to the tender glances those eyes could
give.</p>
<p>But just now, I had to exclude all distracting
thoughts, and forcing my mind back to the present
situation, I again marveled at the non-appearance
of Case Rivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s fallen through the earth again,&rdquo;
Norah suggested; &ldquo;by the way, Mr. Brice, what do
you think about that fall? Mr. Rivers is no doubt
under some strange hallucination, but all the same,
may there not be some foundation on which he
based his dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe! There must be! That mind of his is
too sure-fire to hang on so desperately to a mere
dream. He had some experience of a strange
nature, and it included something that he looks upon
as falling through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;ve a vague idea of a motor
accident. Say, a motor car ran into a stone wall,
and he was hurled high in the air, and landed in
the East River&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how that implies falling through
the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say he slid down a high bank to reach
the river&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no high bank near the morgue, and he
was fished out in that locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he needn&rsquo;t have fallen in there! In fact,
he couldn&rsquo;t have,&mdash;he must have floated or drifted
a considerable distance to have had his clothing torn
from him&mdash;and to have reached the state of exhaustion
and freezing that so nearly culminated in
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but even yet, you haven&rsquo;t suggested anything
like falling through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Smarty, what&rsquo;s your idea? I
see you&rsquo;re dying to spring something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I&rsquo;ve thought from the beginning. I
believe he was in some cold country, Canada, or
somewhere, and fell down through a mine shaft,
or into a deep old well, or perhaps merely an excavation
for a new, large building. But, anyway, whatever
it was, his last impression was of falling down
into the ground. Then when he struck he was
knocked unconscious. Then, he was taken to a
hospital, or somewhere, and as the fall had utterly
blotted out his memory, he was kept in confinement.
Then, somehow he broke loose and came to New
York,&mdash;or, maybe, he was brought to New York
for treatment by the doctors and he got away and
either threw himself into the river or fell in accidentally,
and when he was rescued he still remembered
the fall but nothing else concerning his disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough, Norah, as a theory. But seems
to me, in that case, he would have been sought
and found by the people who had him in
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the point of it all! They don&rsquo;t want
to find him! They know just where he is, and all
about him, but they won&rsquo;t tell, for it suits their base
purposes to have him lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>have</i> cooked up a scheme! And he
killed Amos Gately?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but if so, he did it unknowingly. Perhaps
these people who are looking after him, secretly
hypnotized him to do it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Norah! come off! desist! let up! Next
thing you know you&rsquo;ll be having him in the movies!
For you never thought up all that stuff without getting
hints for it from some slapstick melodrama!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, people who are absolutely without
imagination can&rsquo;t expect to see into a mystery!
But, you won&rsquo;t see any Mr. Rivers <i>this</i> morning,&mdash;I
can assure you of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to her typewriter, and I took up my
telephone.</p>
<p>I could not get Rivers at his home address, and I
next called up Miss Raynor.</p>
<p>She replied, in agitated tones, that Rivers had
been to see her for a few minutes, and that he had
left half an hour before. She begged me to come
around at once.</p>
<p>Of course, I went.</p>
<p>I found her in a strange state of mind. She
seemed like one who had made a discovery, and was
fearful of inadvertently disclosing it.</p>
<p>But when I urged her to be frank, she insisted
she had nothing to conceal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything, Mr. Brice, truly I
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I mean, anything new or
anything that I haven&rsquo;t told you. Mr. Rivers was
here this morning for a very short call. He said
that while his memory had not returned, he had a
queer mental impression of being on a search for a
paper when he fell through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go down into the earth to seek the
paper?&rdquo; I asked, thinking it best to treat the matter
lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned, in all seriousness, &ldquo;but he
believes he was commissioned to hunt out a valuable
paper, of some sort, and while on the quest he fell
through the earth, by accident. It was the shock of
that that impaired his memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufficient cause!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help saying.</p>
<p>Olive bristled: &ldquo;Oh, I know you don&rsquo;t believe his
story,&mdash;almost nobody does,&mdash;but I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; and Zizi was in the room. One could
never say of that girl that she entered or came in,&mdash;she
just&mdash;was there,&mdash;in that silent, mysterious
way of hers. And then with equally invisible motions
she was sitting opposite me, at Olive&rsquo;s side,
on a low ottoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mr. Rivers very well,&rdquo; Zizi announced,
as if she were his official sponsor, &ldquo;and what he
says is true, no matter how unbelievable it may
sound. He says he fell through the earth, and so
he <i>did</i> fall through the earth, and that&rsquo;s all there is
about <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Zizi!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a loyal
little champion! And just how did he accomplish
the feat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be explained in due season,&rdquo; and Zizi&rsquo;s
big black eyes took on a sibylline expression as she
gazed straight at me. &ldquo;If you were told, on good
authority, that a man had crossed the ocean in an
aeroplane, you&rsquo;d believe it, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to me a parallel
case,&rdquo; I demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither is Case Rivers a parallel case,&rdquo; Zizi
giggled, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s the real thing in the way of Earth
Fallers. And when you know all, you&rsquo;ll know
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child was exasperating in her foolish retorts
and yet so convincing was the determined shake of
her little black head that I was almost tempted to
believe in her statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a baby sphinx, Zizi,&rdquo; and Olive looked
at her affectionately, &ldquo;but honestly, Mr. Brice, she
keeps my spirits up, and she is so positive herself
of what she says that she almost convinces me. As
for Mrs. Vail, she swallows everything Zizi says
for law and gospel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just what is it you say, now, Zizi?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much, kind sir. Only that Case Rivers
is a gentleman and a scholar, that his memory is on
the home stretch and humming along, and that if
he&rsquo;s after a paper,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, incidentally he&rsquo;s Amos Gately&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scream of agony from Zizi interrupted my
speech, and jumping to her feet she danced round
the room, her forefinger thrust between her red lips,
and her little, eerie face contorted as with pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it, Zizi?&rdquo; cried Olive, running to
the frantic girl.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail, hearing the turmoil, came running in,
and she and Olive held Zizi between them, begging
to know how she was hurt.</p>
<p>Catching an opportunity, Zizi looked at me, over
Mrs. Vail&rsquo;s shoulder, and the message shot from her
eyes was fully as understandable as if she had
spoken. It said, &ldquo;Do not mention any hint of Case
Rivers&rsquo; possible connection with the Gately murder,
and do not mention the snowflake drawn on the
blotter in Mr. Gately&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, quite a lengthy and comprehensive speech to
be made without words, but the speaking black
eyes said it as clearly as lips could have done.</p>
<p>I nodded my obedience, and then Zizi giggled and
with her inimitable impudence, she turned to Olive,
and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like the White Queen, in &lsquo;Alice,&rsquo;
I haven&rsquo;t pricked my finger yet, but I probably shall,
some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you screaming about, then?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Vail, inclined to be angry, while Olive looked
amused and mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency,&rdquo; and Zizi grinned at her. &ldquo;First
aid to the injured,&mdash;or, rather, prevention, which is
worth a pound of first aid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; said Mrs. Vail, a little annoyed
at being fooled so. &ldquo;I thought you were nearly
killed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you knew a lady once who was nearly
killed did she yell like that?&rdquo; asked Zizi, with an
innocent smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Vail; &ldquo;but how did you
know I once saw a lady nearly killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind-reading!&rdquo; replied Zizi, and then Pennington
Wise arrived, and we all shamelessly ignored
Mrs. Vail and her yarns to listen to his
report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot doing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he added,
gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bring you unpleasant news,
Miss Raynor, but you&rsquo;ll have to know sooner or
later&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; said Olive, bravely; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going
to tell me my guardian was&mdash;was not a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so; it is useless to try to soften the
truth. Amos Gately was the receiver of important
Government secrets, learned by Sadie Kent, the
telegrapher. She carried them to Rodman, who in
turn transmitted them to Gately, who, it seems, had
a way of getting the information to the enemy. Of
course, the secret wireless station, recently discovered,
was used, as well as other means of communication.
I won&rsquo;t go into details, Miss Raynor, but
Amos Gately was the &lsquo;man higher up,&rsquo; who thought
himself safe from discovery because of his unimpeachable
reputation for integrity, and also because
of the infinite precautions he had taken. Indeed, if
he had not fallen a victim to the personal charms
of &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; his share in the wrong might never
have been learned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>Olive listened to all this, white-faced and still,&mdash;her
lips a tense, drawn line of scarlet,&mdash;her expression
a stony calm.</p>
<p>Zizi, watching her closely, and with loving care,
slipped her little brown paw into Olive&rsquo;s hand, and
noted with satisfaction the faint answering smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Olive said, after a thoughtful pause,
&ldquo;it is as well, then, that Uncle Amos did not&mdash;did
not live to be&mdash;disgraced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Wise, gravely; &ldquo;he would have
faced a Federal prison had it all been discovered
while he lived. That will be Rodman&rsquo;s fate,&mdash;if he
is not held for the crime of murder. But I think he
will not be. For his alibi clears him and it was to
escape the graver charge that he has told so much
of the spy business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we are as far as ever from
the discovery of the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; Wise returned; &ldquo;it may be
we are on the very eve of solving the mystery.
Rivers is on the warpath&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Wise,&rdquo; Olive
broke in, &ldquo;that Mr. Rivers was here this morning,
and he seems to have a slight glimmer of returning
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has? Good! Then it will all come back to
him. I&rsquo;ve been looking up this aphasia-amnesia
business, and quite often when the patient begins to
recover his memory, it all comes back to him with
a bang! Where is Rivers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He went away&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Olive&rsquo;s lips quivered, and so plainly did she show
her feelings that we all saw at once she feared that
Rivers had fled, <i>because</i> of his returning memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; declared Zizi, stanchly; &ldquo;Mr. Rivers
is white clear through! He&rsquo;ll come back,
soon, and he&rsquo;ll bring the paper he&rsquo;s after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What paper?&rdquo; demanded Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poipers! the poipers!&rdquo; scoffed Zizi; &ldquo;did
you ever know a case, oh, Wise Guy, that didn&rsquo;t
revolve round and hinge on a poiper? Well, the
dockyments in the case is what he&rsquo;s a-soichin&rsquo; for!
See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zizi acted the <i>gamine</i> she was irresistibly
funny and we all laughed, which was what she
wanted to lighten the strain of the situation.</p>
<p>Rivers was a mystery, indeed. Every one of us,
I think, felt that he might be connected with the
Gately affair. All of us, that is, but Olive,&mdash;and
who could tell what she thought?</p>
<p>But Pennington Wise had a question to ask, and
he put it straightforwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That day you were lured to Sadie &lsquo;The Link&rsquo;s&rsquo;
house, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you said, or
rather, you agreed when Rodman said you were his
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. Will you tell us why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive flushed, but more with anger than embarrassment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man threatened me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he first
tried to make love to me, and when I repulsed him,
he told me that unless I would promise to marry him
he would tell something that would be a living reproach
to the memory of my dead guardian. I
declared he could say nothing against Amos Gately.
Then he whispered that Mr. Gately was a spy! I
couldn&rsquo;t believe it, and&mdash;yet, I had seen just a few
things,&mdash;had heard just a few words, that filled my
heart with a fear that Mr. Rodman was speaking
the truth. So I thought I&rsquo;d better say what he
asked me to, though I knew I&rsquo;d kill myself rather
than ever marry him. But I wasn&rsquo;t greatly afraid,
except that I knew I was in his power. Oh, I don&rsquo;t
like to think about that day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive broke down and hid her face in her hands,
while Zizi&rsquo;s thin little arms crept round her and
held her close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one more query, Miss Raynor,&rdquo; and Wise
spoke very gently; &ldquo;are you,&mdash;were you engaged to
Amory Manning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive lifted her face, and spoke composedly:
&ldquo;No, Mr. Wise, I was never engaged to him. We
were good friends, and I think he had a high regard
for me, but no words of affection ever passed between
us. I admire and respect Mr. Manning as a
friend, but that is all.&rdquo; And then a lovely blush
suffused Olive&rsquo;s face, followed quickly by a look of
pain,&mdash;and we knew she was thinking of Rivers,
and his possible defection. Never have I seen a
woman&rsquo;s face so easy to read as Olive Raynor&rsquo;s.
Perhaps because of her pure, transparent character,
for in my enforced intimacy with her, as I
managed her estate, I had learned that she was an
exceptional nature, high-minded, fine, and conscientious
in all things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think,&rdquo; Olive went on, &ldquo;that Mr. Manning
will ever be found. I think he has been
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Wise, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, he was a Secret Service man. Many
times he has had the narrowest escape with his life,
and&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure of this,&mdash;but I think now, he was
on the track of the nest of spies with which my&mdash;with
which Mr. Gately was mixed up. A few slight
incidents, otherwise unexplainable, make this clear
to me now, though I never suspected it before. My
uncle disliked Mr. Manning, and it may have been
because he knew he was in the Government&rsquo;s employ.
And though I know Mr. Gately would never have
moved a finger to put Amory Manning out of the
way, yet George Rodman may have done so. Oh,
it&rsquo;s all so mysterious, so complicated,&mdash;but of this
I&rsquo;m sure, Case Rivers is in no way connected with
the whole matter. He is a man from some distant
city, he is unacquainted in New York, and he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
here Olive broke down utterly and fell into a hysterical
burst of weeping.</p>
<p>Zizi rose and gently urged Olive to go with her
from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>A silence fell as the two girls disappeared. It
was broken by Mrs. Vail, who remarked, dolefully,
&ldquo;I do hope that nice Mr. Rivers will come back,
for dear Olive is <i>so</i> in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Pennington Wise, &ldquo;Miss Raynor
in love with Rivers! That will never do! Why,
we&rsquo;ve no idea who he is. He may be a fortune-hunter
of the lowest type!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; denied Mrs. Vail, &ldquo;he is a most
courteous gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; stormed Wise; &ldquo;although,
perhaps, I spoke too strongly just now when I called
him names!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially as he has no name!&rdquo; I put in; &ldquo;in
fact, he calls himself a self-named man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wise smiled: &ldquo;He is a witty chap,&rdquo; he conceded,
&ldquo;and I like him immensely. But it&rsquo;s up to us, Brice,
to safeguard Miss Raynor&rsquo;s interests, and a possible
suitor for the hand of an heiress ought, at least, to
know his own ancestors! And then, again, unless
he recovers his memory and can deny it, there&rsquo;s a
fair chance that he had some hand in the Gately
murder. We can&rsquo;t get away from that snowflake
pattern drawn on the blotter. Rivers was there, in
that room, he sat at Gately&rsquo;s desk, opposite Gately
himself,&mdash;I mean, of course, this is the way I reconstruct
the matter,&mdash;and if he didn&rsquo;t shoot Gately
then and there, at least, we have no proof that he
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he did,&rdquo; I admitted, for Wise&rsquo;s statement
of the matter was convincing,&mdash;and beside,
Norah thought so, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you think again!&rdquo; came in a wild little
voice, and there was Zizi at my elbow fairly shaking
her little clenched fist in my face. &ldquo;Mr. Badman
Brice, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of follow-up thinks a-coming
to you, and you&rsquo;d better begin &rsquo;em right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked like a little fury as she danced around
my chair and exploded the vials of her wrath.
&ldquo;That Mr. Rivers is a perfectly good man,&mdash;I
know! He and Miss Olive are in love,&mdash;but they
don&rsquo;t hardly know it themselves,&mdash;bless &rsquo;em! And
Mr. Rivers he won&rsquo;t tell her, anyway, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s a
nobleman,&mdash;one of Nature&rsquo;s maybe,&mdash;and again,
maybe he&rsquo;s a real one from Canada, or wherever
he hails from. But, anyway, he no more killed anybody
than I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Ziz,&mdash;bully for you! As a loyal
friend you&rsquo;re there with the goods!&rdquo; Wise smiled
at her. &ldquo;But after all, you&rsquo;ve got only your loyalty
to bank on. You don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hunch,&rdquo; said Zizi, pounding one little
fist into the other palm, &ldquo;and when it comes to certainty,&mdash;Death
and Taxes have nothing on my
hunches!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Clear as Crystal</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, people! What&rsquo;s the matter, Zizi?
I&rsquo;ll be on your side! Bank on me, little
one, to the last ditch. And, by jumping
Jupiter, Brice, I believe the last ditch is coming
my way! No, I haven&rsquo;t got a strangle-hold on that
eloping memory of mine yet, but I &rsquo;ave &rsquo;opes. I&rsquo;ve
had a glimmer of a gleam of a ray of light on my
dark, mysterious past, and I beflew myself straight
to good little old Doctor Rankin, who&rsquo;s my Trouble
Man every time. And he says that it&rsquo;s the beginning
of the end. That any day, almost any hour
now, I may burst forth a full-memoried and properly
christened citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, old chap,&rdquo; and thrilled at the
elation in his tones, I held out my hand. &ldquo;Go in
and win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t it be fine when you remember?&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Vail, wringing her hands in excitement;
&ldquo;why, I knew a man once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rivers encouraged her, in his kindly way,
&ldquo;what happened to the lucky chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was affected something as you are,&mdash;or,
as you were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but Wise couldn&rsquo;t stand for
what seemed likely to be a long story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Vail,&rdquo; he interrupted her,
&ldquo;but, really, I must run away now, and I want a
word or two with Mr. Rivers first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good lady subsided, but it was plain to be
seen she was disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; and a smiling Olive appeared
in the doorway. &ldquo;Am I wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you wanted?&rdquo; the eager, hungry smile
Rivers gave her was pathetic. For it was so spontaneous,
so gladly welcoming that it was as if a
light was suddenly extinguished when the man, on
second thought, hid his real feelings and advanced
with a courteous but rather formal air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always wanted,&rdquo; he resumed, lightly, but
the joy was gone from his tones, and a mere
friendly greeting resulted. Surely, he was a gentleman,
but he would make no advances while uncertain
of his claim in full to that title.</p>
<p>And then, he looked at her curiously, as if wondering
whether she would hold any place in his
restored memory,&mdash;should the restoration really
occur.</p>
<p>It was Zizi who broke the silence that fell on us
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my way, Penny,&rdquo; she said, in such a
wistful, pleading tone, that I felt sure no breathing
human heart could refuse her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your way, Zizi?&rdquo; Wise said, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want us all to go&mdash;all of us,&mdash;over to Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s office&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead!&rdquo; cried Rivers; &ldquo;I promised old
Brice, here, that I&rsquo;d go this very day, and I broke
my appointment. Sorry, old man, but I had to see
Friend Doctor, on the jump. Let&rsquo;s go now, in accordance
with the Witch&rsquo;s whim, and we&rsquo;ll take the
big wagon, and all go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He often called Zizi the Witch, or the Elf-child,
and she liked it from him, though she usually resented
any familiarity.</p>
<p>She smiled at him, but I noted an undercurrent
of sadness in her gaze, and I knew she was thinking
of the evidence of the snow crystal.</p>
<p>For though Zizi liked Rivers a lot, and though
she really had faith in his innocence of wrongdoing,
yet her whole fealty was to Pennington Wise, and
her hunch about the snowflake drawing might lead
to disastrous results in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Olive shrank from going to her guardian&rsquo;s office,&mdash;she
had never been there since the tragedy,&mdash;but
a few whispered words from Zizi persuaded her to
agree to accompany us.</p>
<p>And to help matters, I told her that if she preferred
not to go into Mr. Gately&rsquo;s rooms, she could
remain in my office with Norah, while we went.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail insisted on being of the party, and ran
briskly off to get her bonnet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>The atmosphere seemed peculiarly charged with a
feeling of impending disaster, and yet, not one of us
would have held back. Pennington Wise was very
grave and quiet; Zizi, on the other hand, was as one
electrified. She sprang about with quick, darting
motions, she giggled almost hysterically and then
suddenly became most gentle and tender. She ran
for Olive&rsquo;s wraps herself, and bringing them, put
them on with the careful air of a mother dressing
her child.</p>
<p>Olive, herself, was as one dazed. She, now and
then, looked toward Rivers with a shy, yet wistful
glance, and he looked back with a big, hearty smile
that seemed to warm her very soul.</p>
<p>We piled into the big touring car and made a
quick run to the Puritan Building.</p>
<p>Then we all went to my office first. Norah did
the honors as prettily as any hostess in her own
home, and her ready tact helped Olive to overcome
her dread of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rivers, at last, &ldquo;what are we waiting
for? I thought we were to go over to Mr.
Gately&rsquo;s rooms. Perhaps Miss Raynor and Mrs.
Vail would prefer to stay here with Miss MacCormack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Olive, firmly, &ldquo;I want to go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah looked at her uncertainly. Then, probably
realizing that for Olive to remain behind would
be harder than to face whatever might happen, she
said, quite casually, &ldquo;Very well, Miss Raynor, let
us all go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think we were all imbued with a sense of fear,
a sort of premonition that the visit across the hall
would be productive of grave results.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>Rivers was the most light-hearted of the party,
and yet I somehow felt that his cheerfulness was
forced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The keys, Brice?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;oh, you have
them. All right, my boy, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the same stillness that was on the rest
of us fell on him, too, and we entered the rooms in
silence.</p>
<p>I went first, through Jenny&rsquo;s room, on to the
middle room, and paused just beyond the desk.</p>
<p>Rivers was next, but Zizi pushed her lithe little
body through the group, and came through the door
just ahead of him.</p>
<p>Rivers entered with the strangest look I have ever
seen on any human face. It was a transition,&mdash;not
sudden but gradual,&mdash;from the dark of forgetfulness
to the dawn of memory.</p>
<p>And then, just as he neared Amos Gately&rsquo;s desk,
Zizi, without seeming insistence,&mdash;indeed, without
seeming intent,&mdash;guided him to the chair opposite
Mr. Gately&rsquo;s desk-chair.</p>
<p>Mechanically, almost unconsciously, Rivers
dropped into the seat and sat at the great table-desk,&mdash;just
where, presumably, the slayer of Amos
Gately had sat.</p>
<p>With one of her sudden, swift motions, Zizi put
the telephone receiver into his left hand, which involuntarily
opened to take it, and thus exposed to
view the snow crystal drawn on the blotter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>A dead silence fell on us all as Rivers sat there
staring at the little sketch. He fairly devoured it
with his eyes, his face, meanwhile, becoming set,&mdash;like
a face of stone.</p>
<p>Then, raising his blank, staring eyes, his gaze
sought out Olive and, looking straight at her, he
gave a low, piercing cry,&mdash;wrung from him as from
a soul in mortal agony,&mdash;and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed Amos Gately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the scene that followed this announcement
was the strangest I have ever experienced.
For myself, I felt a sudden sinking, as if the bottom
had fallen out of the universe. In fact, a whimsical
idea flashed through my stunned brain that I was
&ldquo;falling through the earth,&rdquo;&mdash;or into a bottomless
pit.</p>
<p>The white faces that I looked at meant nothing
to me,&mdash;I saw them as in a dream, so dazed was
my intelligence.</p>
<p>And then, they assumed their individuality and I
saw that Olive&rsquo;s lovely countenance was a complete
blank; like me, she failed to grasp the full meaning
of Rivers&rsquo; confession.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vail, her eyes closed, lay back limply in a
chair, and groaned audibly, while Norah buried her
face in a nearby silken curtain and sobbed.</p>
<p>Pennington Wise looked like a man who has just
heard the worst,&mdash;but who expected it. However,
the shock had unnerved him, I could see by his
tightly clenched hands and set lips, as he strove to
control himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Rivers sat like a stone statue, only his eyes, desperate
in their concentration, showed the fearful
mental strain he was suffering.</p>
<p>Zizi,&mdash;bless her!&mdash;stood behind him,&mdash;hovering,
watchful,&mdash;more like a guardian angel than a
Nemesis, and with her eerie, elfin face full of
anxious suspense.</p>
<p>Rivers drew a long sigh; he looked round the
room, appraisingly, his quick, darting glance taking
in every detail, he scanned the desk and all the
things on it, he looked through into the farther
room,&mdash;the Blue Room,&mdash;and saw the great war
map hanging on the wall, and then he rose, straightened
his broad shoulders, and shook himself as one
who arouses from sleep.</p>
<p>Breathlessly, we who watched, saw a great light
come into his eyes,&mdash;a new self-respect, a new sense
of importance showed in his whole bearing and,
with a smile of infinite tenderness he looked at Olive
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Amory Manning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zizi yelled. There is no other word for it. Her
shrieks of joy filled the room, and she danced about
waving her thin little arms like a veritable pixy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; she cried, in ecstacy, &ldquo;Oh,
Penny, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; and with a spring across the
room, she landed in Wise&rsquo;s arms, who patted her
shoulder, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Ziz, don&rsquo;t flatten out <i>now</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>Meantime, Rivers was finding himself. He stood
still, with his hands tightly grasping the chair back,
and his face working as he received and classified
the memories crowding thickly back upon his burdened
brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he said, struggling with his
thoughts, &ldquo;I know all about it, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amory!&rdquo; cried Olive, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your <i>voice</i>! I
know you <i>now</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could all note the change in his speech. Until
this moment Rivers had spoken in the peculiar tones
I had noticed the first time I met him. Monotonous
tones, almost devoid of inflection. Now, his voice
was normal, and even more melodious than the
average.</p>
<p>Surely, the man had found himself, but if he was
really Amory Manning,&mdash;well, my mind refused to
go further.</p>
<p>And he had also said that he killed Amos Gately!</p>
<p>But I felt no need of asking questions, or even of
wondering, for the man before us looked so responsible,
so capable of self-explanation, that like the
rest of the assembly, I merely waited his further
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to be told,&rdquo; he said, and his
smile changed to a look of pain. He gave another
glance at Olive, and even took a step toward her,&mdash;then
he seemed to collapse, and sinking back into the
chair he had vacated, he hid his face in his hands
and groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; whispered an imperious little voice,
and Zizi was behind him again, her hand on his
shoulder, her tones urgent and encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; and Manning, for we felt no doubt of
his identity now,&mdash;spoke firmly and bravely. He
did not look at Olive, and it was clear that this was
intentional.</p>
<p>Instead, he turned to Zizi, and seemed to address
himself to her.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t have done better if he wanted helpful
sympathy, for the black eyes that gazed at him
were soft and tender with something like a maternal
sweetness.</p>
<p>This mood of Zizi&rsquo;s, rarely shown, was one of
her chiefest charms, and Manning gratefully accepted
it, and let it help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell all,&mdash;now and here?&rdquo; he asked,
glancing at Pennington Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the detective, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;Yes, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo; Manning was entirely composed
now, but it was evident he was holding himself
together by a strong effort. Also, he carefully
refrained from looking in Olive&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>This alarmed me a little, for to my mind, it
argued him a guilty man, and, that, in fact, he had
declared himself to be.</p>
<p>Norah and I exchanged glances of understanding,&mdash;or,
rather, of not understanding,&mdash;and Manning
began his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will begin right here,&rdquo; he said, in a
slow, methodical way, and with the air of one who
has a disagreeable duty to perform, but who has no
intention of shirking any part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember everything&mdash;everything,&mdash;and it is
not all pleasant remembrance! But it must be told,
and then I must go at once and report to my
superiors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Amory Manning, a special agent in the
Secret Service. I was detailed by the Government to
hunt down a certain branch of the enemy spy system
in New York City, and in pursuance of my duty, I
learned that Amos Gately was the man I
sought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manning still kept his glance averted from Olive,
indeed, he looked almost constantly at Zizi, whose
dark little face, lovely in its sympathy, seemed to
drink in his every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew all about Rodman, I was on the trail of
Sadie, &lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; and I came here, that afternoon,
primarily to get an incriminating paper, which
would have been positive evidence against Gately,
and I had orders to arrest him if he was unable
to clear himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had a stormy interview, and I found the
man was guilty of the blackest treason. He had
been a receiver of the stolen information sold by
&lsquo;The Link,&rsquo; and had transmitted it, by secret channels
of his own, to the enemy government. I
charged him with this, and he put up a fight. I
tried to overcome him, and take him peaceably, but
he was desperate and evaded my grasp. He ran
toward that map in the other room, and I stood just
here, where I am now sitting. I had overturned
the chair in our struggle and as I suddenly saw him
push aside the map and enter what was beyond all
doubt a secret mode of exit, I fired at him. Of
course, I meant merely to wing him,&mdash;merely to
prevent his escape,&mdash;but as I fired he turned and
received the bullet in his heart. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t
know this at the time, nor did I know where he had
gone. But I heard the car descend, and knew that
it must be a private elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran into that room, and finding the elevator
entrance, behind the map, fastened, I flew out to the
hall and downstairs. In my haste, there being no
car waiting, I thought I could get down faster by
the stairs. But after running down two flights, I
saw a waiting elevator and got in. I had dropped
my pistol somewhere when trying to stuff it into
my overcoat pocket as I ran downstairs. But I
gave no thought to anything save preventing the
escape of my prisoner. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t then
know how seriously he was hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I failed to find the exit from the private
elevator, and never dreaming it was in the building
next door, I hunted this building for quite a time.
I investigated the ground floor, the basement and
sub-basement, but couldn&rsquo;t find it. Greatly puzzled,
I began the search all over again, and then, Olive,&mdash;Miss
Raynor, came, and&mdash;later, I found that
others had discovered the dead body of the man I
had shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I waited only to be sure of this, and then started
at once to report to the Federal Bureau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; I interrupted, unable to keep quiet,
as the recollection surged over me, &ldquo;and you went
down Third Avenue on the street-car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Manning&rsquo;s face showed only an intense
effort at reconstructing the scene, &ldquo;I was going to
stop at my rooms on the way, for something I
needed, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Wise said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in
the Case Rivers phase of your existence. Don&rsquo;t forget
you&rsquo;re the Man Who Fell Through the Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange smile passed over Manning&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just coming to that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am that
man, and I can tell you right now, how, where, and
why I made the trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes were upon him. This strange talk,&mdash;and
he had been so sensible up to now. Was the hallucination
of falling through the earth destined to mar
his newly returned sanity?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; repeated Zizi, and the calmness of her
voice restored Manning&rsquo;s poise, and also raised my
hopes of a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were with me, Brice,&rdquo; Manning looked at
me, as if for corroboration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I was in the car with you, but we were
not near enough to speak. There was a big
crowd,&mdash;and I was standing at the rear end, while
you were well forward. But I say, Rivers, it&rsquo;s hard
to believe that man in the car was you! Why,
you&rsquo;re not the same type&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; the speaker waved his hand as
if to check interruption, &ldquo;I <i>am</i> Manning,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll explain
later,&mdash;but now I want to get that occasion
well in hand. I got off the front end of the car,&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what you did,&mdash;and as I stepped off,
a sudden fierce blast of wind nearly took me off my
feet. I was right in the middle of the street but it
seemed the middle of a howling blizzard, and as
I took a step,&mdash;I went down an open manhole into
the sewer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I distinctly remember,&mdash;the street cleaners
were working there, shoveling the snow into the
sewer. They had no business to leave the manhole
open and unguarded, but that black squall was so
sudden and terrific, no one could see or know anything
for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I knew perfectly well, as I fell in,
what had happened, but then,&mdash;and I remember this,
too,&mdash;I fell and fell,&mdash;down, down,&mdash;it seemed for
miles; I was whirled dizzily about,&mdash;but still I fell&mdash;on
and on,&mdash;interminably. I felt my consciousness
going,&mdash;at first, abnormally acute, my senses became
dulled, and I had only a sensation of falling&mdash;ever
falling&mdash;through the earth!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There my memory ceases. And as I next remember
finding myself in a bed in Bellevue Hospital,
and as I have had detailed to me the full
account of my being found floating, nearly dead,
in the East River, I can only accept the inevitable
conclusion that I was carried by the rush of the
sewer, straight out to the river, and picked up for
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a sign of life was found, after I was taken
to the morgue, was of the nature of a miracle, and
only the most desperate efforts fanned that little
spark into resuscitation. The rest you know. The
shock, the exposure, the cold, and perhaps a blow
or two on my head, all combined, resulted in a total
loss of memory as to my identity or to the events
of my former life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had only remaining the positive recollection of
that fall&mdash;&rdquo; Manning shuddered,&mdash;&ldquo;that interminable,
that never-ending fall through the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you fell through water,&rdquo; said Wise, his
eyes staring at the narrator of all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. My realization of falling
only lasted until I struck the water in the sewer.
That, doubtless, knocked me out for good and all,&mdash;mentally,
I mean. I have to thank my wonderful
vitality and strong constitution for the fact that I
really lived through the catastrophe. Think what
it means! Hurtled through that rushing torrent
of a sewer half filled with melted snow and water,&mdash;flung
out into the river, dashed about among the
floating cakes of ice, and all with sufficient force to
tear off my clothing,&mdash;and yet to live through it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going some!&rdquo; cried Zizi, and the sparkle of her
dancing eyes and the delight on her small, smiling
face, made the rude phrase seem quite fit for the
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Manning went on, quietly, &ldquo;I have
accomplished my quests. I have been working hard
to discover three things,&mdash;my own identity, the
whereabouts of Amory Manning, and&mdash;the slayer
of Amos Gately. I, myself, am the answer to all
three questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell; and then Olive spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are no slayer,&mdash;you are no murderer. You
shot Mr. Gately by accident, in the pursuance of
your duty. You are not only exonerated, but you
did a deed, in freeing the world of a traitor, that
entitles you to a Distinguished Service Cross! I
respected my guardian,&mdash;I was fond of him,&mdash;but
now I know what he was. I have only contempt and
hatred of him! You, Amory, are a hero!&mdash;my
hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olive held out her hands with a beautiful gesture
of affection, and Manning strode across the room
to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have the only forgiveness I care for,&rdquo; he
said, and his face was radiant. &ldquo;Now, I must go at
once, and report. My duty lies to my country,&mdash;to
my government! Oh, there are so many things yet
to think of! They,&mdash;the Government,&mdash;offered a
reward for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you have won yourself!&rdquo; exclaimed
Penny Wise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chuckled Zizi, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve won the reward
offered for Mr. Gately&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated,&mdash;&ldquo;for
the man who freed the world of one more
traitorous viper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, incidentally,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve cleared up
the puzzle of the man who fell through the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well that Gately is no more,&rdquo; Manning
said, musingly; &ldquo;he was especially dangerous because
he was in such a high position and so trusted
by everybody. Rodman was an equal scoundrel,
but he worked inconspicuously. Gately banked on
his reputation for honor and probity,&mdash;used his own
well-earned fame to further the meanest cause on
earth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, I&rsquo;m glad he is unable to do
further harm. I didn&rsquo;t mean to kill him&mdash;it was
an accident,&mdash;but the world is well rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Olive, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the end justifies the means,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Vail, a little hysterically. &ldquo;Why, once I heard
of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruthlessly, I shut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accept my greetings, Mr. Manning,&rdquo; I said,
offering my hand to our new-found friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
proud to know you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there was a scene of handshaking and
smiling welcome such as any hero might be proud
to receive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Manning said, at last, &ldquo;that
day, I was hunting a paper, you know. If it was
sent off, there will yet be trouble from it. Has it
been found, do you know, Mr. Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; what sort of a paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the stolen telegrams. It was concealed,
I had reason to think, somewhere in Gately&rsquo;s
desk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so&mdash;wait,&mdash;I had just thought I knew
where to look for it, when Gately said something
that made me telephone for assistance in his arrest.
I was waiting for an answer to my call&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you drew the snow crystal!&rdquo; Zizi cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;And then, I saw something
that hinted a possible hiding-place&mdash;ah, here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to the desk and picked up the heavy,
ornate gold penholder. He fussed with it a moment,
and then, unscrewing it in the middle, showed
that it was a cleverly constructed place to hide a
tiny roll of thin paper.</p>
<p>There was such a roll in it, and pulling it out,
Manning grinned with glee. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he cried,
joyfully; &ldquo;this is the paper, a Government secret!
See, you read it by that carriage-call check, and
it&rsquo;s safe now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a paper filled with rows of letters, such a
paper as had been found in Sadie&rsquo;s possession and
also in Rodman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I am satisfied,&rdquo; Manning declared; &ldquo;and
now I must go straight down to the Federal Bureau.
But first&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Zizi, reading his thoughts; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
excused!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a saucy smile, she flew over and kissed
Olive heartily. Then, with an imperious air, she
took command, and almost before we knew it she
had herded every last one of us, except Olive and
Manning, across the hall to my office.</p>
<p>I was the last to go, and Manning smiled broadly
as he called after me, &ldquo;I want Miss Raynor to say
once more that she exonerates me, and then I&rsquo;ll report
to my other Superior!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing happily, I entered my office, and found
it a scene of hilarious gayety. Mrs. Vail was positively
cavorting about, as Norah waltzed her up
and down the room; Pennington Wise was sitting
on the corner of my desk whistling dance music for
them, and Zizi, her arms waving, executed a sort of
glory dance of her own making-up.</p>
<p>After a time, the door of the Gately room opened,
and Olive&rsquo;s blushing face appeared, followed by that
of the Man Who Fell Through the Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to correct a misstatement of mine,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;I told you I wasn&rsquo;t engaged to Amory Manning&mdash;but,&mdash;I
am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two came over to my office, and the ovation
we gave them was second only to our reception of
Manning himself a few moments before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i> it is Manning?&rdquo; Wise teased her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Olive, most seriously. &ldquo;You see he
was in disguise when he was himself, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>Her voice was lost in the shout that went up at
her remark, and she looked around in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Manning, smiling; &ldquo;I was.
You see, when I became a Secret Service man, I had
certain peculiar duties assigned me and it was important
that I shouldn&rsquo;t be known. So I adopted
a permanent disguise,&mdash;oh, nothing much,&mdash;merely
a mild dye for my hair and beard, which washed
off easily, and a pair of big, horn-rimmed specs,
which were really rather becoming than otherwise.
But Olive, and many of my acquaintances knew me
only in this way. I wore a Vandyke beard, and
a small mustache of the Charles I type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you see, when I was taken in at the hospital,
and shaved, I continued to adopt a clean-shaven
face. Also, the dye was thoroughly washed
out in the sewer, and as my memory was washed
out with it, I experienced no surprise at finding a
light-haired man in my mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olive tells me, too, that my voice was of a
totally different caliber, due, no doubt, to a certain
vacuity made in my brain by the loss of my memory.
Oh, well, that&rsquo;s the story. And but for my peculiarity
of drawing snow crystals,&mdash;a thing I&rsquo;ve done
just about all my life,&mdash;and but for Zizi&rsquo;s quick-witted
realization of this habit of mine, I might
never have regained consciousness of my true personality!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably something else would have brought it
about,&rdquo; said Wise, &ldquo;but your drawing of the snow
crystals began with Brice&rsquo;s first interview with you.
I ought to have found that drawing on Gately&rsquo;s
desk long ago! Stoo-pid!&rdquo; and he beat his head
in mock self-abasement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Zizi, giving Wise a smile that was
both impudent and affectionate, &ldquo;you should have,
oh, Wise Guy! You ought to have found that snowflake
drawing for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what I have you for, Ziz, to look up
clews for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do, Penny Wise. I&rsquo;m only your
Pound Foolish, but at least, I can see through a
clew that is as clear as crystal!&rdquo;</p>
